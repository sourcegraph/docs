# Sourcegraph Docs

<!-- Working branch for September 2024 Release -->

Welcome to the Sourcegraph documentation! We're excited to have you contribute to our docs. We've recently rearchitectured our docs tech stack â€” powered by Next.js, TailwindCSS and deployed on Vercel. This guide will walk you through the process of contributing to our documentation using the new tech stack.

## Get started

To get started with this template, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sourcegraph/docs.git sourcegraph-docs
```

Navigate to the project directory by typing the following command in your terminal:

```sh
cd sourcegraph-docs
```

Before the dependencies are install make sure your local machine has the following versions of `node` and `pnpm`:

* node: `v20.8.1`
* pnpm: `8.13.1`

**Note**: If you have `asdf` available you can install the above versions for only this repository by running the following command from your terminal in the root folder:

```sh
asdf install
```

Now that the base requirements of the project have been satisfied, we can install the required dependencies to run the development server!

```sh
pnpm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

Finally, open [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

## Writing and contributing to Sourcegraph Docs

### (Easy) Using GitHub to edit existing files
You can easily update existing docs pages using [GitHub's file editor](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files). All you need to do is:

1. Find the corresponding `.mdx` file in the [folder structure](#folder-structure).
2. Click the pencil icon to open the file editor.
3. Make your changes.
4. Click on the green "Commit changes..." button.
5. Provide a Commit message and an Extended description.
6. Click on the green "Propose changes" button to create a PR.
7. Add a PR reviewer to the Reviewers panel by clicking on the gear icon.
8. Tag `@maedahbatool` in the `#docs` Slack channel and link to your PR to get a quick review.
> NOTE: "Edit from GitHub" is generally recommended for text-based edits. For more structural-based contributions like adding React components and code blocks, it's always better to go with a local setup. This way, you can preview changes before you commit.

### (Advanced) Local dev environment
To add new or update existing docs content. Create a new branch and checkout by via:

```sh
git switch -c BRANCH_NAME_HERE
```

### Folder structure

The folder structure is exactly the same here. All the docs reside within the `/docs` folder. Here you'll find separate folders for every docs section like `cody`, `code_search`, `cli`, etc.

- Navigate to the relevant relevant section for your contribution
- If you're adding a new page, create a new MDX file (e.g., `my-new-page.mdx`) in the appropriate folder

### Using MDX

We use MDX for our documentation, which allows you to seamlessly integrate JSX (React components) within Markdown. Write your content using standard markdown syntax. For example,

```

# This is heading 1

This is an introductory paragraph.

## This is heading 2

### This is heading 3

These are the details for heading three.

This is how you add a [demo-link](https://sourcegraph.com/)

- This is a bullet 1
- This is bullet 2
- This is bullet 3
```

### Including React Components

The only difference with this new stack is its ability to use React components. We have a set of reusable React components located in the `src/components` directory. These components are designed to enhance the user experience and maintain consistency across our documentation.

For example the cards layout appears by using the `<Callout>` component that can add `note`, `info`, or `warning` notices in docs.

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/CleanShot%202023-12-12%20at%2012.00.29%402x.png)

You can use this component within your content as follows:

```js
<Callout type="note">Cody is currently in Beta for all users.</Callout>
```

This snippet creates a single `<QuickLink>` titled as "Get Cody". You can add as many cards you want while filling out all the relevant details.

Here are the list of all the supported components we have:

- `<QuickLinks>`
- `<ProductLinks>`
- `<LinkCards>`
- `<Callout>`

For a better docs experience we'll continue adding more components in future.

### Adding a link

To add a `link` to any docs page, use the following routing syntax: `[Link text](path-to-link)`.

- Do not include `/docs` in the link paths. The base URL will be `sourcegraph.com/docs`
- There should be **no file extension** in the path name

For example, if you want to link to the Cody Quickstart somewhere in the Code Search docs, you should use:

```markdown
- This is a link to [Cody Quickstart](/cody/quickstart) in Code Search docs
- This is a way to hash-link to [Cody for VSCode installation](/cody/clients/install-vscode#verifying-the-installation) in Code Search docs
```

### Adding images and binary assets

For large images and other binary assets, upload them to the `sourcegraph-assets` Google Cloud Storage bucket instead with `gsutil cp -a public-read local/path/to/myasset.png gs://sourcegraph-assets/` (and refer to them as `https://sourcegraphstatic.com/myasset.png`). For a more detailed instructions visit [this page](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/handbook/editing/handbook-images-video/).

> Note: Make sure to use [ImageOptim.app](https://imageoptim.com/mac) to reduce the size of the images before uploading, since large images degrade page loading speed.

## Previewing Changes

### Locally

As you make changes to the documentation, the development server will automatically update. Review your changes by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Submitting your Contribution

Once you're satisfied with your changes, follow these steps:

- Commit your changes
- Create a pull request to the [Sourcegraph documentation repository](https://github.com/sourcegraph/docs).
- Tag `@maedahbatool` in `#docs` channel through Slack to get a quick review
