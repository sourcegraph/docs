# Sharing Notebooks

Notebooks support the following sharing scheme.

## User namespace

### Private Notebooks

This is the default permissions level for all new notebook. Only the creator can view and edit the notebook.

### Public Notebooks

Notebooks can be shared with everyone (public notebooks on [Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com) are viewable by anyone and don't require a Sourcegraph account), or with your entire Sourcegraph instance.

## Sourcegraph organization namespace

Find out more about Sourcegraph organizations and how to create and configure them on the [organizations docs page](/admin/organizations).

### Private organization Notebooks

Only organization members can view and edit the notebook.

### Public organization Notebooks

In self-hosted and managed Sourcegraph instances, everyone who has access to the instance can view the notebook. On [Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com), anyone can view the Notebook. In both cases, only members of the owning Sourcegraph organization can edit the Notebook.
