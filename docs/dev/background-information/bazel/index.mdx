# Bazel at Sourcegraph

Sourcegraph uses [Bazel](https://bazel.build) as its build system. Reach out on [#ask-dev-experience](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C04MYFW01NV) for questions and support.

## Bazel for teammates in a hurry

### Bazel vocabulary

- A _rule_ is a function that stitches together parts of the graph.
  - ex: build go code
- A _target_ is a named rule invocation.
  - ex: build the go code for `./app`
  - ex: run the unit tests for `./app`
- A _package_ is a a group of _targets_.
  - ex: we only have one single package in the example above, the root one.

Bazel uses two types of files to define those:

- `WORKSPACE`, which sits at the root of a project and tells Bazel where to find the rules.
  - ex: get the Go _rules_ from that repository on GitHub, in this exact version.
- `BUILD.bazel`, which sits in every folder that contains _targets_.

To reference them, the convention being used is the following: `//pkg1/pkg2:my_target` and you can say things such as `//pkg1/...` to reference all possible _targets_ in a package.

Finally, let's say we have defined in our Bazel project some third party dependencies (a NPM module or a Go package), they will be referenced using the `@` sign.

- `@com_github_keegancsmith_sqlf//:sqlf`

### Bazel cheat sheet

#### Keep in mind

- Do not commit file whose name include spaces, Bazel does not like it.
- Do not expect your tests to be executed inside the source tree and to be inside a git repository.
  - They will be executed in the sandbox. Instead create a temp folder and init a git repo manually over there.

#### Building and testing things

- `bazel build [path-to-target]` builds a target.
  - ex `bazel build //lib/...` will build everything under the `/lib/...` folder in the Sourcegraph repository.
- `bazel test [path-to-target]` tests a target.
  - ex `bazel test //lib/...` will run all tests under the `/lib/...` folder in the Sourcegraph repository.
- `sg bazel configure` automatically inspect the source tree and update the buildfiles if needed.
- `sg bazel configure godeps` automatically inspect the `go.mod` and update the third parties dependencies if needed.

#### Debugging buildfiles

- `bazel query "//[pkg]/..."` See all subpackages of `pkg`.
- `bazel query "//[pkg]:*"` See all targets of `pkg`.
- `bazel query //[pkg] --output location` prints where the buildfile for `pkg` is.
  - ex: `bazel query @com_github_cloudflare_circl//dh/x448 --output location` which allows to inspect the autogenerated buildfile.
- `bazel query "allpaths(pkg1, pkg2)"` list all knowns connections from `pkg1` to `pkg2`
  - ex `bazel query "allpaths(//cmd/worker, @go_googleapis//google/api)"`
  - This is very useful when you want to understand what connects a given package to another.

#### Running bazel built services locally with `sg start`

> For early adopters only.

First you need to have `bazel` installed obviously, but also `iBazel` which will watch your files and rebuild if needed. We use a tool called `bazelisk` (which is also part of Bazel) to manage the version of `bazel`. It inspects a bunch of files to determine what `bazel` version to use for your repo.

If you want the setup automated run `sg setup`, otherwise you can install it manually by executing the following commands:

- `brew install bazelisk`
- `brew install ibazel`

Then instead of running `sg start oss` you can use the `bazel` variant instead.

- `sg start oss-bazel`
- `sg start enterprise-bazel`
- `sg start codeintel-bazel`
- `sg start enterprise-codeintel-bazel`

##### How it works

When `sg start` is booting up, the standard installation process will begin as usual for commands that are not built with Bazel, but you'll also see a new program running
`[  bazel]` which will log the build process for all the targets required by your chosen commandset. Once it's done, these services will start and [`iBazel`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-watcher)
will take the relay. It will watch the files that Bazel has indentified as having dependencies for your services, and rebuild them accordingly.

So when a change is detected, `iBazel` will build the affected target and it will be restarted once the build finishes.

##### Caveats

- You still need to run `sg bazel configure` if you add/remove files or packages.
- Error handling is not perfect, so if a build fails, that might stop the whole thing. We'll improve this in the upcoming days, as we gather feedback.
