# AWS CodeCommit integration with Sourcegraph

You can use Sourcegraph with Git repositories hosted on [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/).

| Feature                                                | Supported? |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| [Repository syncing](/admin/code-hosts/aws-codecommit) | ✅         |
| [Browser extension](/integration/browser-extension)    | ❌         |

## Repository syncing

Site admins can [add AWS CodeCommit repositories to Sourcegraph](/admin/code-hosts/aws-codecommit).

## Browser extension

The [Sourcegraph browser extension](/integration/browser-extension) does not yet support AWS CodeCommit. This means that you won't get hovers, go-to-definition, and find-references from Sourcegraph when viewing your code on AWS CodeCommit's web interface.
