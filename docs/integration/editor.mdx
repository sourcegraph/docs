# Editor integrations

Sourcegraph's editor integrations allow you search and navigate across all of your repositories without ever leaving your IDE or checking them out locally.

Get up to speed quickly, learn best practices and, find code to re-use all while maintaining your flow using our editor integrations.

We currently have integrations with these editors:

-   [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.sourcegraph)
-   [JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, PyCharm, GoLand, etc.)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9682-sourcegraph)
