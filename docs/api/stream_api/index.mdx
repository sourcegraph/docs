# Sourcegraph Stream API

With the Stream API you can consume search results and related metadata as
a stream of events. The Sourcegraph UI calls the Stream API for all interactive searches.
Compared to our [GraphQL API](/api/graphql/), it offers shorter times to first results and
supports running exhaustive searches returning a large volume of results without
putting pressure on the backend.

## Endpoint
`/.api/search/stream`

| Sourcegraph URL                 | The URL of your Sourcegraph instance, or https://sourcegraph.com.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| query                           | A Sourcegraph query string, see our [search query syntax](/code-search/queries)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| version (optional)              | The version of the search query syntax. We recommend to explicitly set the version. The latest version is "V3". (Default: "V3")                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| pattern type (optional)         | Either "keyword", "standard", or "regexp". This pattern type is only used if the query doesn't already contain a `patternType:` filter. (Default: "standard")                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| maximum line length (optional)  | If set, will truncate the context field of `ChunkMatch` such that no line is longer than max-line-len. (Default: -1 (no limit))                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| enable chunk matches (optional) | Enables chunk matches. Must be parseable as boolean. (Default: false)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| display limit (optional)        | The maximum number of matches the backend returns. If the backend finds more than display-limit results, it will keep searching and aggregating statistics, but the matches will not be returned anymore. Note that the display-limit is different from the query filter `count:` which causes the search to stop and return once we found `count:` matches. (Default: -1 (no limit)) |
| context lines (optional)        | The number of lines around a match that should be returned. Works only in conjunction with `cm=true`. Must be parseable as boolean. (Default: 1)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Event stream format

The API responds with a stream of events. Each event consists of exactly two
fields, event and data, one per line. Events are separated by 2 newline
characters, `\n\n`. The value of `event:` is always a string that describes the
type of the event. The value of `data:` is always JSON.

```text
event: <event-type> // event 1
data: <JSON>

event: <event-type> // event 2
data: <JSON>

...

event: done // last event
data: {}
```

> NOTE:
> The search stream API follows the [server-sent
> events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#event_stream_format) format. However, we do not guarantee compatibility
> with any third-party clients written for server-sent events, and recommend using the src-cli tool or writing your own wrapper around the API.

### Event-types

Events can be of the following types:

| event-type |                                   description                                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| matches    | matches can be of type content, path, commit, diff, symbol and repo              |
| progress   | statistics such as match count, count of repositories with matches, and duration |
| filters    | suggestions for additional filters to further narrow down the search             |
| alert      | info, warning and error messages                                                 |
| done       | always the last event                                                            |

Refer to the [interface definitions of our typescript client](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/client/shared/src/search/stream.ts?L12) to learn about the schema of the event-types.

## Example (curl)

On Sourcegraph.com we can run queries without authentication.

```shellsession
$ curl --header "Accept: text/event-stream" \
     --get \
     --url "https://sourcegraph.com/.api/search/stream" \
     --data-urlencode "q=r:sourcegraph/sourcegraph stream results patternType:keyword count:1" \
     --data-urlencode "v=V3"

## FAQ

### Q: How can I run an exhaustive search directly against the Stream API?

To search a pattern over all indexed repositories, add `count:all` and remove all repo filters. For example, to search all indexed repositories for the string "secret", you can run the following command

```bash
curl --header "Accept:text/event-stream" --get --url "https://sourcegraph.com/.api/search/stream" --data-urlencode "q=secret count:all"
```

If you don't want to write your own client, you can also use Sourcegraph's [src-cli](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli).

```bash
src search -stream "secret count:all"
```

### Q: Are there plans for supporting a streaming client or interface with more functionality (e.g., parallelizing multiple streaming requests or aggregating results from multiple streams)?

There are currently no plans to support additional client-side functionality to interact with a streaming endpoint. We recommend users write their own scripts or client wrappers that handle, e.g., firing multiple requests, accepting and aggregating the return values, and additional result formatting or processing.
