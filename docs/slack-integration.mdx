The Sourcegraph Slack integration brings the power of [Deep Search](/deep-search) directly into your Slack workspace. When you mention `@Sourcegraph` in any Slack channel or thread, a Deep Search conversation starts right there—no context switching required.

## Features

- **In-thread Deep Search**: Mention `@Sourcegraph` in any thread to ask questions—Deep Search uses the thread's messages as context to help answer
- **Follow-up questions**: Continue the conversation by mentioning `@Sourcegraph` again in the same thread
- **Direct messages**: Message the Sourcegraph bot directly to have private conversations about your code
- **Rich link previews**: Deep Search links shared in Slack automatically unfurl with context

## Getting started

To set up the Sourcegraph Slack integration:

1. Navigate to **Administration → Slack integration** in your Sourcegraph instance
2. Click **Connect to Slack**
3. Authorize the Sourcegraph app in your Slack workspace
4. Once connected, you can mention `@Sourcegraph` in any channel where the app is added

## Using the integration

### Starting a conversation

In any Slack channel or direct message where the Sourcegraph app is present, mention `@Sourcegraph` followed by your question. You can specify a repository to search in as part of your message:

```
@Sourcegraph How does the router handle middleware in the gorilla/mux repository?
```

Sourcegraph will respond in a thread with a detailed answer powered by Deep Search.

### Using thread context

Deep Search automatically uses the messages in the current Slack thread as context. This means you can have a discussion with colleagues and then ask:

```
@Sourcegraph Can you answer this?
```

Deep Search will understand what "this" refers to based on the preceding conversation.

### Asking follow-up questions

Continue the conversation by replying in the thread and mentioning `@Sourcegraph` again:

```
@Sourcegraph Can you show me where the JWT tokens are validated?
```

### Direct messages

You can also message the Sourcegraph bot directly for private conversations about your codebase. Find the Sourcegraph app in your Slack workspace and start a direct message.

## Troubleshooting

### The app doesn't respond to mentions

- Ensure the Sourcegraph app has been added to the channel
- Verify the integration is properly connected in **Administration → Slack integration**—errors will appear on this page if the integration is not configured correctly
- Check that [Deep Search is enabled](/deep-search#enabling-deep-search) for your Sourcegraph instance

### Checking integration status

The **Administration → Slack integration** page displays any configuration errors and automatically detects issues with your setup. It will verify that Slack can connect to your Sourcegraph instance and check that all required scopes and permissions are correctly configured in your Slack app.

## Permissions reference

This section explains the permissions used by the Sourcegraph Slack app. All required permissions are automatically provided via the app manifest during the setup process—no manual configuration is needed. The **Administration → Slack integration** page will automatically verify that your app's permissions match what Sourcegraph expects.
