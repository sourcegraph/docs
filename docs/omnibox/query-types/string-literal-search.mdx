# String Literal Search

<p className="subtitle">String literal search is a query type or workflow that allows you to find exact text matches by enclosing your search term in quotes, ensuring precise matching instead of keyword-based results.</p>

When you enclose text in quotes like `"// Scheme for Authorization header"` or `"unrecognized HTTP Authorization request"`, Sourcegraph performs an exact match search rather than keyword matching. After finding relevant files, you can select specific ones to analyze and ask follow-up questions about their contents - creating an interactive workflow that combines precise search with contextual code analysis.
