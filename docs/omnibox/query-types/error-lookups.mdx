# Error Lookups

<p className="subtitle">Error Lookups is a conversational workflow for the Sourcegraph omnibox that helps developers understand error messages by providing plain-English explanations of when and why specific errors occur in their codebase and external service calls.</p>

Developers can use Error Lookups to understand error messages occurring in their codebase. When encountering an error, especially from external services or dependencies, developers can use the omnibox to:

1. Search for specific error messages across their codebase
2. Select relevant files where the error is thrown or handled
3. Request a natural language explanation of the error's context, triggers, and implications

The workflow combines Sourcegraph's code search capabilities with AI-powered analysis to provide developers with clear, contextual understanding of error scenarios. Instead of having to dig through documentation or source code manually, developers can quickly grasp:

* The specific conditions that trigger the error
* The underlying reasons for the error occurrence
* Common scenarios where this error might appear
* Potential approaches to handling or preventing the error

This approach helps developers make more informed decisions about error handling and debugging, reducing the time spent deciphering cryptic error messages or searching through external documentation.

## Try it

* Query for `"unsupported value for type filter"`
* Select the file(s) where the error is thrown
* Follow up with "Explain when and why this error is thrown"
