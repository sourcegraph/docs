# Sourcegraph Analytics

Enterprise customers can use Sourcegraph Analytics to get a clear view of usage, engagement, performance, and impact.

Our managed [Sourcegraph Analytics service](https://analytics.sourcegraph.com) for Cody and Code Search usage data is available for:

-   [Sourcegraph Cloud](/cloud) customers
-   Self-hosted customers that have fully enabled usage telemetry and are running a supported version of Sourcegraph (5.9+)
-   [Sourcegraph workspaces](https://workspaces.sourcegraph.com)

To get started, follow our [enablement instructions](#enablement-instructions).

## Enablement instructions

### Self-hosted and Cloud

To enable Sourcegraph Analytics for self-hosted or Cloud instances:

-   Create an account on [Sourcegraph Accounts](https://accounts.sourcegraph.com/), or find the email address associated with your existing account.
-   Contact your Sourcegraph Technical Advisor or point of contact (or email us at support@sourcegraph.com if you don't know your contact), provide them with the email address you used to register above and ask for access to Sourcegraph Analytics.
-   They will validate your account and link it to your Sourcegraph Enterprise instance's usage metrics.
-   Sign in to [Sourcegraph Analytics](https://analytics.sourcegraph.com).

Customers on air-gapped deployments should reach out to their account team to discuss options.

### Sourcegraph workspaces

To access Sourcegraph workspaces:

-   Ensure you are an admin of your [Sourcegraph workspace](https://workspaces.sourcegraph.com).
-   Sign in to [Sourcegraph Analytics](https://analytics.sourcegraph.com) with the same account you use for your workspace.

## Data export and API

Sourcegraph Analytics includes a CSV export option with key metrics like the number of searches, chats, autocomplete suggestions, Completion Acceptance Rate (CAR%), and more. The data is split by user, day, client/editor, and programming language.

You can export data directly from the Sourcegraph Analytics web interface, or programmatically via the API. For API access and detailed instructions, see our [Analytics API documentation](/analytics/api).

## Metrics

We provide a set of metrics that can be used to monitor Sourcegraph usage, engagement, performance, and impact within your enterprise.

### Command metrics (deprecated)

_As of Sourcegraph version 5.10, commands are being deprecated in favor of our new feature, chat prompts. As a result, if your Sourcegraph instance is running version 5.10 or later, you may see decreased command usage. In the coming weeks, these command metrics will be deprecated and replaced with new prompt metrics on the Chats tab._

| **Metric**              | **Description**                                                                                             |

### CSV export

You can download underlying user activity data from Sourcegraph Analytics as a CSV export. To do this, click the `Export user-level data` button at the top right of any tab within the portal.

When exporting, you can group the data by:

-   User
-   User and month
-   User and day
-   User, day, client, and language

And you can select the timeframe for the export using the `startDate` and `endDate` parameters (with `YYYY-MM-DD` values).

Each row in the CSV represents a user's activity for a specific combination of these groupings (e.g., a particular day, month, client, and/or language). The CSV includes metrics such as searches, code navigation actions, chat conversations, code completions, and more.

#### Important Notes

-   Not all billable actions are included: Some Sourcegraph features, such as code monitors and batch changes, are not yet represented as columns in the CSV export. We plan to add these fields soon. If a user engages with these features, their activity may appear as a “blank” row in the export. If a user is listed as an “Active Sourcegraph User” (see column D), but the rest of the row is blank, they performed a billable action that isn’t currently tracked in the CSV
-   A zero or blank value in a row can also mean that the user did not perform tracked actions for that specific date, client, or language
