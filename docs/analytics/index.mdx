### Command metrics (deprecated)

_As of Sourcegraph version 5.10, commands are being deprecated in favor of our new feature, chat prompts. As a result, if your Sourcegraph instance is running version 5.10 or later, you may see decreased command usage. In the coming weeks, these command metrics will be deprecated and replaced with new prompt metrics on the Chats tab._
