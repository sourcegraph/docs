# Sourcegraph Analytics API

The Sourcegraph Analytics API is an API that provides programmatic access to your Sourcegraph Analytics data, including usage metrics, user activity, and performance data.

## Access tokens

For Sourcegraph Analytics, you can generate an access token for programmatic access. Tokens are long-lived with an optional expiry and have the same permissions to access instance data as the user who created them.

### Token management APIs

Token management is currently only available via the Sourcegraph Analytics API. Token management APIs are authenticated via the `cas` session cookie.

- Sign in to [Sourcegraph Analytics](https://analytics.sourcegraph.com).
- Retrieve your session cookie, `cas`, from your browser's developer tools.

- Export the cookie as an environment variable to use in the following commands:

```sh
export CAS_COOKIE="<CAS_COOKIE_VALUE>"
```

#### Token creation

Create the token by running the following command:

```sh
curl -X POST https://analytics.sourcegraph.com/api/service-access-tokens \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -H "Cookie: cas=$CAS_COOKIE" \
 -d '{}'

# Optionally include displayName, expiresAt, or both in the request body.
# If expiresAt is not provided, the token will never expire and must be revoked manually.
# -d '{"displayName": "My Analytics Token", "expiresAt": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"}'
```

The response will include the token ID, secret, creation date, and, if provided, display name and expiration date. For example:

```json
{
  "id": "4cf96e80-d5f3-4af0-a28d-3c70ba97abb4",
  "displayName": "My Analytics Token",
  "secret": "sams_at_abcdefghijk",
  "createdAt": "2025-05-28T12:00:00Z",
  "expiresAt": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
}
```

#### Token listing

List the tokens by running the following command:

```sh
curl -X GET https://analytics.sourcegraph.com/api/service-access-tokens \
 -H "Cookie: cas=$CAS_COOKIE"
```

Each token in the response will include the token ID, creation date, a boolean indicating if the token has expired, and display name and expiration date if provided. For example:

```json
{
  "tokens": [
     {
      "id": "5a140b00-3a79-497d-bcfb-c1d2e3d8c747",
      "displayName": "My Analytics Token",
      "createdAt": "2025-05-27T12:00:00Z",
      "expiresAt": "2025-05-27T13:00:00Z",
      "isExpired": true
    },
    {
      "id": "eaf8a6f1-1302-43f6-a9ad-f9862d75e959",
      "createdAt": "2025-05-28T12:30:00Z",
      "expiresAt": "2025-05-28T13:30:00Z",
      "isExpired": true
    },
    {
      "id": "d7df6636-99d0-4266-9f32-a2fb7ccbfcd5",
      "displayName": "My Analytics Token 2",
      "createdAt": "2025-05-28T15:00:00Z",
      "isExpired": false
    },
    {
      "id": "8ea63000-a164-44ca-8834-bb71e9b788fb",
      "createdAt": "2025-05-28T15:30:00Z",
      "isExpired": false
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Token revocation

Revoke a token by running the following commands:

```sh
export TOKEN_ID="<TOKEN_ID>"

curl -X DELETE https://analytics.sourcegraph.com/api/service-access-tokens/$TOKEN_ID \
 -H "Cookie: cas=$CAS_COOKIE"
```

<Callout type="note">The revocation request does not produce output. To verify that a token has been revoked, list the tokens and verify that `isExpired` is `true`.</Callout>

## API reference

To authenticate to the API, follow the instructions for [token creation](#token-creation).

Export your access token as an environment variable:

```sh
export ACCESS_TOKEN="<ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

### CSV export

To generate a CSV export of the data for a specific instance, run the following commands:

```sh
export INSTANCE_URL="<INSTANCE URL>" # e.g. example.sourcegraphcloud.com

curl -X GET "https://analytics.sourcegraph.com/api/reports/by-user-client-date?instanceURL=$INSTANCE_URL" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Optional granularity values can be specified. If not specified, the default is `by_user_day_client_language`.

- `by_user`,
- `by_user_month`,
- `by_user_day`,
- `by_user_day_client_language`

```sh
export INSTANCE_URL="<INSTANCE_URL>" # e.g. example.sourcegraphcloud.com
export GRANULARITY="<GRANULARITY>"

curl -X GET "https://analytics.sourcegraph.com/api/reports/by-user-client-date?instanceURL=$INSTANCE_URL&granularity=$GRANULARITY" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Optional `startDate` and `endDate` values (formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`) can be specified. Both parameters are optional. If neither is specified, the default is all time. If only one is specified, then only the start or end date filter will be applied.

Example:

```sh
export INSTANCE_URL="<INSTANCE_URL>" # e.g. example.sourcegraphcloud.com
export START_DATE="2025-01-01"
export END_DATE="2025-12-31"

curl -X GET "https://analytics.sourcegraph.com/api/reports/by-user-client-date?instanceURL=$INSTANCE_URL&startDate=$START_DATE&endDate=$END_DATE" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```
