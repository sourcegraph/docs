## Data export

Sourcegraph Cloud Analytics also includes a CSV export option with key metrics like the number of searches, chats, autocomplete suggestions, completion acceptance rate (CAR %), and more. The data is split by user, day, client/editor, and programming language, perfect for automating retrieval and analyzing data in ways that make the most sense to your organization.
