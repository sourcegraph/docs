# Incoming webhooks

A Sourcegraph instance can be configured to receive events from code hosts via incoming webhooks. This allows Sourcegraph to react more quickly to events outside the instance and decreases the polling required for changes.

Webhooks currently serve three purposes for reacting to external events:

-   Keeping code on Sourcegraph fresh by responding to new code being pushed to a repository
-   Keeping batch changes changeset details up to date
-   Speed up Sourcegraph reacting to permission changes on the code host

See the table below for code host compatibility:

          Code host           | Code push | [Batch changes](/batch_changes) | User permissions

----------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------: | :-------: | :--------------:
GitHub | 🟢 | 🟢 | 🟢
GitLab | 🟢 | 🟢 | 🔴
Bitbucket Server / Datacenter | 🟢 | 🟢 | 🔴
Bitbucket Cloud | 🟢 | 🟢 | 🔴
Azure DevOps | 🔴 | 🟢 | 🔴

To receive webhooks both Sourcegraph and the code host need to be configured. To configure Sourcegraph, [add an incoming webhook](#adding-an-incoming-webhook). Then [configure webhooks on your code host](#configuring-webhooks-on-the-code-host)

## Deprecation notice

As of Sourcegraph 4.3.0 webhooks added via code host configuration are deprecated and support will be removed in release 5.1.0.

This includes any webhooks pointed at URLs starting with the following:

-   `.api/github-webhooks`
-   `.api/gitlab-webhooks`
-   `.api/bitbucket-server-webhooks`
-   `.api/bitbucket-cloud-webhooks`

In order to continue using webhooks you need to follow the steps below to [add an incoming webhook](#adding-an-incoming-webhook) and then update the webhook configured on your code host with the new webhook url which will look something like `https://sourcegraph-instance/.api/webhooks/{UUID}`

## Adding an incoming webhook

Before adding an incoming webhook you should ensure that you have at least one [code host connection](/admin/code_hosts/) configured for the code host you want to set up incoming webhooks for.

The incoming webhook will be configured to accept events from a specific code host based on its type and URN.

1. Navigate to **Site Admin > Configuration > Incoming webhooks**
   ![Incoming webhooks page](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/docs/images/administration/config/webhooks/incoming-webhooks-page.png)
2. Click **+ Create webhook**
   ![Adding an incoming webhook](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/docs/images/administration/config/webhooks/adding-webhook.png)
3. Fill out the form:
    1. **Webhook name**: Descriptive name for the webhook.
    1. **Code host type**: Select from the dropdown. This will be filtered based on code host connections added on your instance.
    1. **Code host URN**: The URN for the code host. Again, this will be filtered by code host connections added on your instance.
    1. **Secret**: An arbitrary shared secret between Sourcegraph and the code host. A default value is provided, but you are free to change it.
4. Click **Create**

The incoming webhook will now be created, and you will be redirected to a page showing more details.
![Created webhook](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/docs/images/administration/config/webhooks/webhook-created.png)

Use the Webhook endpoint from the details page to configure [the webhook on your code host](#configuring-webhooks-on-the-code-host).

## Configuring webhooks on the code host

Follow these instructions for setting up webhooks on the code host are specific to each code host type.

### GitHub

GitHub webhooks can be created at the repository level, or at the organization level. We strongly recommend using organization level webhooks, to decrease the amount of work needed to add webhooks to every repository, and ensure new repositories have the webhooks added as well.

If you use multiple organizations, make sure to configure the webhooks in all of them. The same webhook in Sourcegraph can be connected to multiple organizations.

1. Copy the **webhook endpoint** displayed after adding the incoming webhook as mentioned [above](#adding-an-incoming-webhook)
1. On GitHub, go to the settings page of your organization. From there, click **Settings**, then **Webhooks**, then **Add webhook**.
1. Fill in the webhook form:
    - **Payload URL**: the URL you copied above from Sourcegraph.
    - **Content type**: this must be set to `application/json`.
    - **Secret**: the secret token you configured Sourcegraph to use above.
    - **Which events**: select **Let me select individual events**, and then enable:
        - **For repo changes**:
            - `push`
        - **For Batch Changes**:
            - `Issue comments`
            - `Pull requests`
            - `Pull request reviews`
            - `Pull request review comments`
            - `Check runs`
            - `Check suites`
            - `Statuses`
        - **For repository permissions**:
            - `Collaborator add, remove, or changed`
            - `Memberships`
            - `Organizations`
            - `Repositories`
            - `Teams`
    - **Active**: ensure this is enabled.
1. Click **Add webhook**.
1. Confirm that the new webhook is listed.

<Callout type="note">
	Permission changes can take a few seconds to reflect on GitHub. To prevent
	syncing permissions before the change reflects on GitHub, the permissions
	sync will only occur 10 seconds after the relevant event is received.
</Callout>

Done! Sourcegraph will now receive webhook events to sync data with lower latency and more efficiently.

### GitLab

GitLab webhooks can be installed at the repository or project level. We strongly recommend using project-level webhooks to decrease the amount of work needed to add webhooks to every repository and ensure that new repositories have them added as well.

If you use multiple projects, make sure to configure the webhooks in all of them. The same webhook in Sourcegraph can be connected to multiple projects.

<Callout type="note">
	We currently do not support [system
	webhooks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/system_hooks.html),
	these do not provide the data needed for Sourcegraph.
</Callout>

1. Copy the **webhook endpoint** displayed after adding the incoming webhook as mentioned [above](#adding-an-incoming-webhook)
1. On GitLab, go to your project, and then **Settings > Webhooks** (or **Settings > Integration** on older GitLab versions that don't have the **Webhooks** option).
1. Fill in the webhook form:
    - **URL**: the URL you copied above from Sourcegraph.
    - **Secret token**: the secret token you configured Sourcegraph to use above.
    - **Trigger**:
        - **For repo changes**:
            - `Push events`
        - **For Batch Changes**:
            - `Merge request events`
            - `Pipeline events`
        - **For repository permissions**:
            - _Not supported_
    - **Enable SSL verification**: ensure this is enabled if you have configured SSL with a valid certificate in your Sourcegraph instance.
1. Click **Add webhook**.
1. Confirm that the new webhook is listed below **Project Hooks**.

Done! Sourcegraph will now receive webhook events to sync data with lower latency and more efficiently.

### Bitbucket server

The [Sourcegraph Bitbucket Server plugin](/integration/bitbucket_server#sourcegraph-bitbucket-server-plugin) enables the Bitbucket Server / Bitbucket Data Center instance to send webhooks to Sourcegraph.

Webhooks with the plugin can be installed globally, which is recommended to cover for all repositories.

1. Install the latest version of the [Sourcegraph Bitbucket Server plugin](/integration/bitbucket_server#sourcegraph-bitbucket-server-plugin) on your Bitbucket Server / Bitbucket Data Center instance.
1. On your Bitbucket Server / Bitbucket Data Center instance, go to **Administration > Add-ons > Sourcegraph**
1. Fill in the **Add a webhook** form
    - **Name**: A unique name representing your Sourcegraph instance.
    - **Scope**: `global`.
    - **Endpoint**: The URL found after creating an incoming webhook.
    - **Events**:
        - **For repo changes**:
            - `repo:refs_changed`
        - **For Batch Changes**:
            - `repo:build_status`
            - `pr:activity:status`
            - `pr:activity:event`
            - `pr:activity:rescope`
            - `pr:activity:merge`
            - `pr:activity:comment`
            - `pr:activity:reviewers`
            - `pr:participant:status`
        - **For repository permissions**:
            - _Not supported_
    - **Secret**: The secret you configured when creating the incoming webhook.
1. Confirm that the new webhook is listed under **All webhooks** with a timestamp in the **Last successful** column.

Done! Sourcegraph will now receive webhook events to sync data with lower latency and more efficiently.

### Bitbucket cloud

Bitbucket Cloud webhooks can be installed at the repository or workspace level. While we recommend installing them at the workspace level, the setup for them on the Bitbucket side [is unfortunately a bit more involved](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Bitbucket-questions/How-can-you-create-Workspace-webhooks/qaq-p/2200142).

Using workspace level webhooks is the recommended way to add webhooks to all repositories in a workspace.

To install a webhook at the workspace level, you have to [use the REST API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-workspaces/#api-workspaces-workspace-hooks-post). Bitbucket does not expose a UI to create those.

Follow the REST API docs from Bitbucket. To create a workspace webhook via the API, you need to temporarily create an [app password](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/).

This password requires **webhook read & write** and **repo read** scope, and you must be a workspace owner. You can then use the following command to create the webhook, and fill in the JSON properties as follows:

-   **Description**: A unique name representing your Sourcegraph instance.
-   **URL**: The URL found after creating an incoming webhook.
-   **Events**:
    -   **For repo changes**:
        -   `repo:push`
    -   **For Batch Changes**:
        -   `pullrequest:created`
        -   `pullrequest:updated`
        -   `pullrequest:changes_request_created`
        -   `pullrequest:changes_request_removed`
        -   `pullrequest:approved`
        -   `pullrequest:unapproved`
        -   `pullrequest:fulfilled`
        -   `pullrequest:rejected`
        -   `pullrequest:comment_created`
        -   `pullrequest:comment_updated`
        -   `pullrequest:comment_deleted`
        -   `pullrequest:comment_resolved`
        -   `pullrequest:comment_reopened`
    -   **For repository permissions**:
        -   _Not supported_
-   **Secret**: The secret you configured when creating the incoming webhook.

```bash
$ curl -vf -X POST -u <YOURUSERNAME> -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/workspaces/<YOURWORKSPACE>/hooks -d '
 {
    "description": "<DESCRIPTION>",
    "url": "<WEBHOOK_URL>",
    "active": true,
    "secret": "<SECRET>",
    "events": [
        <LIST_OF_EVENT_NAMES>
    ]
 }'
```

Once created, you can verify it is correctly configured through the UI, by going to any repository in the workspace, then go to **Repository settings** in the sidebar, and then select **Webhooks**. The webhook should appear under workspace hooks:

![Bitbucket Cloud webhook settings page with a workspace webhook configured](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/docs/images/admin/config/bitbucketcloudwebhooks_overview.png)

Done! Sourcegraph will now receive webhook events to sync data with lower latency and more efficiently.

#### Alternative: Creating a repository level webhook from the UI

1. On Bitbucket Cloud, go to each repository, and then **Repository settings > Webhooks**.
1. Click **Add webhook**.
1. Fill in the webhook form:
    - **Title**: Any title.
    - **URL**: The URL found after creating an incoming webhook.
    - **Triggers**:
        - **For repo changes**:
            - `Push`
        - **For Batch Changes**:
            - `Repository > Build status created`
            - `Repository > Build status updated`
            - `Pull request > All events`
        - **For repository permissions**:
            - _Not supported_
1. Click **Save**.
1. Confirm that the new webhook is listed below **Repository hooks**.

Done! Sourcegraph will now receive webhook events to sync data with lower latency and more efficiently.

5. Set the filters how you like, or leave them at the default: **[Any]** and click **Next**.
6. Fill in the webhook form:
    - **URL**: The URL found after creating an incoming webhook.
    - Leave the rest of the fields on the default values.
7. Click **Test** to verify the webhook works. Then click **Finish**.
8. Repeat the steps above, this time choosing **Pull request merged** as your event type.

Done! Sourcegraph will now receive webhook events to sync data with lower latency and more efficiently.

## Webhook logging

Sourcegraph can track incoming webhooks from code hosts to more easily debug issues with webhook delivery. These webhooks can be viewed in two places depending on how they were added:

1. Via **Site Admin > Configuration > Incoming webhooks**
   ![Webhook logs](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/docs/images/administration/config/webhooks/webhook-logs.png)
2. **Deprecated** Via code host connection: **Site Admin > Batch Changes > Incoming webhooks**
   ![Legacy webhook logs](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/docs/images/administration/config/webhooks/webhook-logs-legacy.png)

By default, sites without [database encryption](/self-hosted/encryption) enabled will retain three days of webhook logs. Sites with encryption will not retain webhook logs by default, as webhooks may include sensitive information; these sites can enable webhook logging and optionally configure encryption for them by using the settings below.

### Enabling webhook logging

Webhook logging is controlled by the `webhook.logging` site configuration
option. This option is an object with the following keys:

| Key         | Type      | Default                                                                                                               | Description                                                 |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`   | `boolean` | If `true`, incoming webhooks will be stored.                                                                          | `true` if no site encryption is enabled; `false` otherwise. |
| `retention` | `string`  | The length of time to retain the webhooks, expressed as a valid [Go duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration). | `72h`                                                       |

#### Examples

To disable webhook logging:

```json
{
	"webhook.logging": {"enabled": false}
}
```

To retain webhook logs for one day:

```json
{
	"webhook.logging": {
		"enabled": true,
		"retention": "24h"
	}
}
```

### Encrypting webhook logs

Webhook logs can be encrypted by specifying a `webhookLogKey` in the [on-disk database encryption site configuration](/self-hosted/encryption).
