## How are active users calculated for **Sourcegraph Cody**?

### Billable active users

<Callout type="note">This only applies to Enterprise Cody contracts. Cody Pro users pay for a seat every month, regardless of usage.</Callout>

A billable active Cody user is one who is signed in to their Enterprise Sourcegraph account and actively
interacts with Cody (e.g. they see suggested autocompletions, they run commands or chat with
Cody, they start new discussions, clear chat history, or copy text from chats, they change Cody
settings, and more). 

Simply having Cody installed and being signed in is not enough to be considered a billable user.

Specific categories of user actions that qualify as active Cody usage for billing include, but are not limited to:

- Signing in to Cody in an editor
- Seeing suggested autocompletions and/or accepting/rejecting them
- Running commands or chatting with Cody
- Starting new chats, clearing chat history, copying text from chats, or otherwise interacting with the Cody chat interface in the editor or on the web
- Adding or changing context in a Cody chat interface or changing models
- Interacting with Cody tutorials
- Changing Cody personal or team settings

### Authenticated users

An authenticated Cody user is one who is authenticated (or signed in) to Cody in their editor in a given time period. It also includes all users who interact with Cody on the web. 

Authenticated users is a superset of [billable users](#billable-active-users) defined above. It includes users who are signed in, but do not actively engage with Cody.

## How are active users calculated for **Sourcegraph Code Search** and **Code Intelligence Platform**?

A billable active Code Search or Code Intelligence Platform user is one who is signed into and accesses Sourcegraph. This includes but is not limited to:

- Visiting the Sourcegraph web application or using a browser extension, editor extension, or other client while signed in
- Conducting a search in the Sourcegraph UI or extension
- Hovering and navigating code in the Sourcegraph UI or extension
- Viewing a file or repository in Sourcegraph
- Creating, viewing or receiving a code monitor
- Creating, viewing, modifying or applying a batch change
- Creating, viewing or modifying a code insight
- Creating, viewing or modifying a search notebook

## How is this measured in the product?

A user who has accessed a Sourcegraph product is counted as active once they complete an action that represents usage reflected above.

User counts can be found in the **Site admin** section of the Sourcegraph web application, and Cody-specific usage metrics can be found in the [Cody Analytics service](../cody/clients/enable-cody-enterprise#analytics).
