# Running Sourcegraph Without Kubernetes Service Discovery

<Callout type="warning">
	Not settting these environment variables might prevent pods from starting
	when running without service discovery.
</Callout>

If you are deploying Sourcegraph in an environment **without Kubernetes service discovery** (for example, using Docker Compose or single-container Docker), you must manually configure the frontend service to know about the other service replicas. This is typically required when you are not using RBAC, or when running outside Kubernetes entirely.

## Required Environment Variables

-   INDEXED_SEARCH_INDEXER
-   INDEXED_SEARCH_SERVERS
-   SEARCHER_URL
-   SRC_GIT_SERVERS
-   SYMBOLS_URL

For detailed instructions on how to set these environment variables in a Docker Compose deployment, see the [Docker Compose configuration guide](/admin/deploy/docker-compose/configuration#set-environment-variables).
