# Deployment Overview

Sourcegraph is a powerful code intelligence platform that can be deployed in various ways to suit your organization's needs. This guide will help you understand the available deployment options and choose the best one for your use case.

## Deployment types

Carefully consider your organization's needs and technical expertise when selecting a Sourcegraph deployment method. Each option has different capabilities, resource requirements, and levels of technical expertise needed. Consider your organization's needs carefully, as the deployment method cannot be easily changed for a running instance.

Sourcegraph's recommended deployment methods are, in order:
1. [Sourcegraph Cloud](#sourcegraph-cloud) - This provides a fully managed solution where Sourcegraph handles much of the maintence, monitoring, and upgrading tasks to give you an optimal Sourcegraph experience while immediately getting the latest features into your users' hands. This solution does require your code hosts to be connected to the Sourcegraph managed environment.
2. [Kubernetes Helm](#kubernetes) - Sourcegraph's Kubernetes deployment provides the most robust, scalable, and vetted self-hosted solution. This solution is ideal across many self-hosted customers capable of deploying a multi-node instance, and can be supported within many Kubernetes-capable environments.
3. [Docker Compose](#docker-compose) - Docker Compose provides the preferred single-node deployment solution for Sourcegraph. It can be a good option when the complexities and flexibility provided by Kubernetes Helm are not needed.
4. [Kubernetes Kustomize](#kubernetes) - Kustomize should only be used in place of Helm in specific circumstances. Kustomize tends to be a more advanced solution than Helm, but if it is your preferred deployment method it is a viable and supported method.
5. [Machine Images](#machine-images) - Sourcegraph can be deployed using dedicated Machine Images for specific Cloud providers. This can be a simple solution in specific circumstances, though has its own considerations. If you are considering this path, please discuss with your account team.

### Sourcegraph Cloud

Best for a wide range of customers open to a Sourcegraph managed [Sourcegraph Cloud](https://about.sourcegraph.com/get-started?t=enterprise) solution. Sourcegraph Cloud is hosted and maintained by Sourcegraph.

### Kubernetes

Multi-node, self hosted solution great for large enterprises and/or other orgs looking for the recommended, robust, and scalable deployment method

- **Helm** (Preferred) utilizes pre-packaged charts for templating Sourcegraph deployments
- **Kustomize** utilizes built-in features of kubectl for configuring Sourcegraph deployments

<Callout type="note">Kubernetes is the recommended self hosted deployment method, though it can require specific technical knowledge required to deploy and maintain a deployment on Kubernetes. Teams without in-house Kubernetes expertise should contact their Sourcegraph account representative or [sales@sourcegraph.com](mailto:sales@sourcegraph.com) to discuss in further detail.</Callout>

### Docker Compose

Single-node, self hosted solution for enterprises looking for a simpler, non-Kubernetes solution. Docker Compose can support Sourcegraph at a large range of scales, though this deployment solution tends to be less flexible and robust in comparison to our Kubernetes solution.

### Machine Images

Best for enterprises looking for a self-hosted solution on the Cloud provider of their choice.

Customized machine images allow you to spin up a preconfigured Sourcegraph instance with just a few clicks, all in less than 10 minutes. Currently available in the following hosts:

  <QuickLink title="Amazon Machine Image (AMI)" icon='lightbulb' href="/admin/deploy/machine-images/aws-ami" />
  <QuickLink title="Google Compute Image" icon='presets' href="/admin/deploy/machine-images/gce" />
</QuickLinks>

See [Sourcegraph Machine Images](/admin/deploy/machine-images) for more information.

<Callout type="note">Deploying with machine images requires technical expertise and the ability to maintain and manage your own infrastructure.</Callout>

### On-premises

For setting up quick **non-production** environments on-premises.

  - [Docker Single Container](/admin/deploy/docker-single-container/) - Install Sourcegraph using a single Docker container

### ARM / ARM64 support

Running Sourcegraph on ARM / ARM64 images is not supported for production deployments at this time.
