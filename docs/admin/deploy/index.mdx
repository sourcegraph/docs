# Deployment Overview

Sourcegraph is a powerful code intelligence platform that can be deployed in various ways to suit your organization's needs. This guide will help you understand the available deployment options and choose the best one for your use case.

## Deployment types

Carefully consider your organization's needs and technical expertise when selecting a Sourcegraph deployment method. Each option has different capabilities, resource requirements, and levels of technical expertise needed. Consider your organization's needs carefully, as the deployment method cannot be easily changed for a running instance.

### Sourcegraph Cloud

Best for enterprises looking for a managed [Sourcegraph Cloud](https://about.sourcegraph.com/get-started?t=enterprise) solution. Sourcegraph Cloud is hosted and maintained by Sourcegraph.

### Kubernetes

Best for large enterprises that require a multi-node, self-hosted solution.

- **Helm** utilizes pre-packaged charts for templating Sourcegraph deployments
- **Kustomize** utilizes built-in features of kubectl for configuring Sourcegraph deployments

<Callout type="note">Given the technical knowledge required to deploy and maintain a deployment on Kubernetes, teams without these resources should contact their Sourcegraph representative at [sales@sourcegraph.com](mailto:sales@sourcegraph.com) to discuss alternative deployment options</Callout>

### Machine Images

Best for enterprises looking for a self-hosted solution on the Cloud provider of their choice.

Customized machine images allow you to spin up a preconfigured Sourcegraph instance with just a few clicks, all in less than 10 minutes. Currently available in the following hosts:

  <QuickLink title="Google Compute Image" icon='presets' href="/admin/deploy/machine-images/gce" />
</QuickLinks>

See [Sourcegraph Machine Images](/admin/deploy/machine-images) for more information.

<Callout type="note">Deploying with machine images requires technical expertise and the ability to maintain and manage your own infrastructure.</Callout>

### On-premises

Best for enterprises looking for a fully self-hosted solution.

  - [Docker Compose](/admin/deploy/docker-compose/) - Install Sourcegraph using Docker Compose

For setting up **non-production** environments on-premises.

  - [Docker Single Container](/admin/deploy/docker-single-container/) - Install Sourcegraph using a single Docker container

### ARM / ARM64 support

Running Sourcegraph on ARM / ARM64 images is not supported for production deployments at this time.
