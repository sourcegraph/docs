# Updating a pure-Docker Sourcegraph cluster

This document describes the exact changes needed to update a [pure-Docker Sourcegraph cluster](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker).
Each section comprehensively describes the changes needed in Docker images, environment variables, and added/removed services. **Always refer to this page before upgrading Sourcegraph,** as it comprehensively describes the steps needed to upgrade, and any manual migration steps you must perform.

1. Read our [update policy](/admin/updates/#update-policy) to learn about Sourcegraph updates.
2. Find the relevant entry for your update in the update notes on this page. **If the notes indicate a patch release exists, target the highest one.**

- Users attempting a multi-version upgrade to v4.4.0 may be affected by a [known bug](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/46969) in which an outdated schema migration is included in the upgrade process. _This issue is fixed in patch v4.4.2_

  - The error will be encountered while running `upgrade`, and contains the following text: `"frontend": failed to apply migration 1648115472`.
    - To resolve this issue run migrator with the args `'add-log', '-db=frontend', '-version=1648115472'`.
    - If migrator was stopped while running `upgrade` the next run of upgrade will encounter drift, this drift should be disregarded by providing migrator with the `--skip-drift-check` flag.

**Patch releases**:

- `v3.40.1`
- `v3.40.2`

**Notes**:

- A fix that corrects the default behavior of the `migrator` service is included in this release. An attempt to standardize CLI packages in v3.39.0 unintentionally
broke the default behavior. In order to guard against this, all command line arguments are explicitly set in the deployment manifest.
- **CAUTION** Added the ability to customize postgres server configuration by mounting external configuration files. If you have customized the config in any way, you should copy your changes to the added `postgresql.conf` files [sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker#806](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/pull/806)

**Notes**:

- **If you are connecting to an external Postgres database using SSL/TLS:** Go `1.15` introduced changes to SSL/TLS connection validation which requires certificates to include a `SAN`. This field was not included in older certificates and clients relied on the `CN` field. You might see an error like `x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field`. We recommend that customers using Sourcegraph with an external database and connecting to it using SSL/TLS check whether the certificate is up to date.
  - AWS RDS customers please reference [AWS' documentation on updating the SSL/TLS certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html) for steps to rotate your certificate.
- Confirm that `codeinsights-db-disk` has the correct file permissions via the following command.


```bash
sudo chown -R 999:999 ~/sourcegraph-docker/codeinsights-db-disk/
```

## v3.14 ➔ v3.15

**Patch releases**:

- `v3.15.1`

**Steps**:

1. Update environment variables
  - On `frontend` and `frontend-internal` containers, remove the `LSIF_SERVER_URL` environment variable.
  - On `frontend` and `frontend-internal` containers, set `PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_API_SERVER_URL=http://precise-code-intel-api-server:3186`
  - On all containers, change `JAEGER_AGENT_HOST=jaeger-agent` to `JAEGER_AGENT_HOST=jaeger`
1. Remove all old container deployments
  - `jaeger-agent` container (`deploy-jaeger-agent.sh`)
  - `jaeger-cassandra` container (`deploy-jaeger-cassandra.sh`)
  - `jaeger-collector` container (`deploy-jaeger-collector.sh`)
  - `jaeger-query` container (`deploy-jaeger-query.sh`)
  - `lsif-server` container (`deploy-lsif-server.sh`)
1. Add new container deployments
  - Add a single `jaeger` container [following this spec](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/v3.15.1/deploy-jaeger.sh#L1)
  - Add a single `precise-code-intel-api-server` container [following this spec](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/v3.15.1/deploy-precise-code-intel-api-server.sh)
  - Add a single `precise-code-intel-bundle-manager` container [following this spec](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/v3.15.1/deploy-precise-code-intel-bundle-manager.sh)
  - Add a single `precise-code-intel-worker` container [following this spec](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/v3.15.1/deploy-precise-code-intel-worker.sh)
1. Update prometheus_targets.yml by replacing `lsif-server:3186` with `precise-code-intel-api-server:3186` and replacing `lsif-server:3187` with `precise-code-intel-bundle-manager:3187`
1. Update image tags to `3.15.1`. Change `all sourcegraph/` image tags to `3.15.1`. This includes all images you previously had as `3.14.2` AND all `sourcegraph/<service>` images:

- `index.docker.io/sourcegraph/grafana:3.15.1`
- `index.docker.io/sourcegraph/prometheus:3.15.1`
- `index.docker.io/sourcegraph/redis-cache:3.15.1`
