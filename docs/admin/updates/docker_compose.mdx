## Unreleased

## v5.9.0 ➔ v5.10.1164

- This release resolves an issue in the v5.10.0 release which prevented multiversion upgrades from working. You may now target `v5.10.1164` using migrator's `upgrade` command. Or use autoupgrade by setting the environment variable `SRC_AUTOUPGRADE_IGNORE_DRIFT=true` on the `frontend` container.

## v5.9.0 ➔ v5.10.0

> Warning: Admins are advised to upgrade directly to v5.10.1164 circumventing this release.
>
> Warning: This release updates the database container images from Postgres 12 to Postgres 16, and begins using Wolfi based images. Customers are advised to take a database backup before upgrading! See our [postgres 12 end of life](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/postgres12_end_of_life_notice#postgres-12-end-of-life) notice!
>
> Warning: `automatic` and migrator `upgrade` command will not work for this release, please upgrade directly to `v5.10.1164`, or to a 5.9 version and conduct a standard upgrade using migrator's default `up` command!

#### Notes:
- The container image for pgsql and codeintel-db have been renamed from `postgres-12-alpine` and `codeintel-db` respectively to `postgresql-16`. The `codeinsights-db` container has been renamed to `postgresql-16-codeinsights`. 
- **Admins using external dbs who have not yet upgraded from postgres 12 to postgres 16**, can expect to see database drift after upgrading to `5.10.0`. The new expected schema definition for Sourcegraph is based on postgres 16. The schema drift is the result of automatic changes made to the schema by pg_upgrade utils, and will not cause issues in the application.
  - Admins should not run migrators suggested drift fixes, and should instead upgrade their database from postgres 12 to postgres 16.
- The [Autoupgrade](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/updates/automatic#pre-v500-automatic-multiversion-upgrades) upgrade method, will detect drift and exit before conducting the upgrade unless the env var `SRC_AUTOUPGRADE_IGNORE_DRIFT=true` is set in the server container.
- Postgres 12 image containers cannot be started with data volumes which have been upgraded by postgres 16.

## v5.1.4 ➔ v5.1.5

#### Notes:
- Upgrades from versions `v5.0.3`, `v5.0.4`, `v5.0.5`, and `v5.0.6` to `v5.1.5` are affected by an ordering error in the `frontend` databases migration tree. Learn more from the [PR which resolves this bug](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/55650). **For admins who have already attempted an upgrade to this release from one of the effected versions, see this issue which provides a description of [how to manually fix the frontend db](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/55658).**

## v5.1.3 ➔ v5.1.4

#### Notes:
- Migrator images were built without the `v5.1.x` tag in this version, as such multiversion upgrades using this image version will fail to upgrade to versions in `v5.1.x`. See [this issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/55048) for more details.

## v5.1.2 ➔ v5.1.3

#### Notes:
- Migrator images were built without the `v5.1.x` tag in this version, as such multiversion upgrades using this image version will fail to upgrade to versions in `v5.1.x`. See [this issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/55048) for more details.

## v5.1.1 ➔ v5.1.2

#### Notes:
- Migrator images were built without the `v5.1.x` tag in this version, as such multiversion upgrades using this image version will fail to upgrade to versions in `v5.1.x`. See [this issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/55048) for more details.

## v5.1.0 ➔ v5.1.1

#### Notes:
- Migrator images were built without the `v5.1.x` tag in this version, as such multiversion upgrades using this image version will fail to upgrade to versions in `v5.1.x`. See [this issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/55048) for more details.

## v5.0.6 ➔ v5.1.0

#### Notes:
- See note under v5.1.5 release on issues with standard and multiversion upgrades to v5.1.5.

## v5.0.5 ➔ v5.0.6

#### Notes:
- See note under v5.1.5 release on issues with standard and multiversion upgrades to v5.1.5.

## v5.0.4 ➔ v5.0.5

#### Notes:
- See note under v5.1.5 release on issues with standard and multiversion upgrades to v5.1.5.

## v5.0.3 ➔ v5.0.4

#### Notes:
- See note under v5.1.5 release on issues with standard and multiversion upgrades to v5.1.5.

## v4.4.2 ➔ v4.5.0

#### Notes:

This release introduces a background job that will convert all LSIF data into SCIP. **This migration is irreversible** and a rollback from this version may result in loss of precise code intelligence data. Please see the [migration notes](/admin/how-to/lsif_scip_migration) for more details.

## v4.3 ➔ v4.4.1

#### Notes:

- Users attempting a multi-version upgrade to v4.4.0 may be affected by a [known bug](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/46969) in which an outdated schema migration is included in the upgrade process. _This issue is fixed in patch v4.4.2_
- The error will be encountered while running `upgrade`, and contains the following text: `"frontend": failed to apply migration 1648115472`.
  - To resolve this issue run migrator with the args `'add-log', '-db=frontend', '-version=1648115472'`.
  - If migrator was stopped while running `upgrade` the next run of upgrade will encounter drift, this drift should be disregarded by providing migrator with the `--skip-drift-check` flag.

## v4.1 ➔ v4.2.1

#### Notes:

- This upgrade adds the [node-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) deployment, which collects crucial machine-level metrics that help Sourcegraph scale your deployment.

## v3.43 ➔ v4.0

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v4.0.1`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v4.0.1/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.
- `jaeger` (deployed with the `jaeger-all-in-one` image) has been removed in favor of an [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) DaemonSet + Deployment configuration. See [Configure a tracing backend](/admin/deploy/docker-compose/operations#configure-a-tracing-backend)
- Exporting traces to an external observability backend is now available. Read the [documentation](/admin/deploy/docker-compose/operations#configure-a-tracing-backend) to configure.
- The bundled Jaeger instance is now disabled by default. It can be [enabled](/admin/deploy/docker-compose/operations#enable-the-bundled-jaeger-deployment) if you do not wish to utilise your own external tracing backend.

## v3.42 ➔ v3.43

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v3.43.2`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.43.2/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.

## v3.41 ➔ v3.42

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v3.42.2`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.42.2/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.

## v3.40 ➔ v3.41

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v3.41.0`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.41.0/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.
- `caddy` is upgraded to version 2.5.1 and contains a breaking change from version 2.5.0. Incoming `X-Forwarded-*` headers will no longer be trusted automatically. In order to preserve existing product functionality, the Caddyfile was updated to trust all incoming `X-Forwarded-*` headers. [#828](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/pull/828)
- The Postgres DBs `frontend` and `codeintel-db` are now given 1 hour to begin accepting connections before Kubernetes restarts the containers. [#4136](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph/pull/4136)

## v3.39 ➔ v3.40

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v3.40.2`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.40.2/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.
- `cadvisor` now defaults to run in `privileged` mode. This allows `cadvisor` to collect out of memory events happening to containers which can be used to discover underprovisoned resources. [#804](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/pull/804)

## v3.38 ➔ v3.39

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v3.39.1`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.39.1/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.

- `v3.39.1`

#### Notes:
- We made a number of changes to our built-in postgres databases (the `pgsql`, `codeintel-db`, and `codeinsights-db` container)
  - **CAUTION**: Added the ability to customize postgres server configuration by mounting external configuration files. If you have customized the config in any way, you should copy your changes to the added `postgresql.conf` files [sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker#792](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/pull/792).
  - Increased the minimal memory requirement of `pgsql` and `codeintel-db` from `2GB` to `4GB`.
  -`codeinsights-db` container no longer uses TimescaleDB and is now based on the standard Postgres image [sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker#780](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/pull/780). Metrics scraping is also enabled.

## v3.37 ➔ v3.38

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v3.38.1`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.38.1/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.

- `v3.38.1`

#### Notes:
- **Minimum version of 1.29 for docker compose is required for this update**
- This release adds the requirement that the environment variables `SRC_GIT_SERVERS`, `SEARCHER_URL`, `SYMBOLS_URL`, and `INDEXED_SEARCH_SERVERS` are set for the worker process.

## v3.36 ➔ v3.37

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v3.37.0`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.37.0/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.
- This release adds a new container that runs database migrations (`migrator`) independently of the frontend container. Confirm the environment variables on this new container match your database settings.
- **If performing a multiversion upgrade from an instance prior to this version see our [upgrading early versions documentation](/admin/updates/migrator/upgrading-early-versions#before-v3370)**

## v3.35 ➔ v3.36

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v3.36.0`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.36.0/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.

## v3.34 ➔ v3.35

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v3.35.1`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.35.1/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.
- The `query-runner` service has been decommissioned in the 3.35 release and will be removed during the upgrade. To delete the `query-runner` service, specify `--remove-orphans` to your `docker-compose` command.
- There is a [known issue](/code_insights/how-tos/Troubleshooting#oob-migration-has-made-progress-but-is-stuck-before-reaching-100) with the Code Insights out-of-band settings migration not reaching 100% complete when encountering deleted users or organizations.

## v3.33 ➔ v3.34

#### Notes:
- Target the tag [`v3.34.0`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.34.0/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.

## v3.31 ➔ v3.32

#### Notes:
- Target the tag [`v3.32.0`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.32.0/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.

## v3.30 ➔ v3.31

> WARNING: **This upgrade must originate from `v3.30.3`.**

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v3.31.2`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.31.2/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.
- The **built-in** main Postgres (`pgsql`) and codeintel (`codeintel-db`) databases have switched to an alpine-based Docker image. Upon upgrading, Sourcegraph will need to re-index the entire database. All users that use our bundled (built-in) database instances **must** read through the [3.31 upgrade guide](/admin/migration/3_31) _before_ upgrading.

## v3.29 ➔ v3.30

> WARNING: **If you have already upgraded to 3.30.0, 3.30.1, or 3.30.2** please follow [this migration guide](/admin/migration/3_30).

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v3.30.3`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.30.3/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.

## v3.28 ➔ v3.29

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v3.29.0`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.29.0/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.
- This upgrade adds a new `worker` service that runs a number of background jobs that were previously run in the `frontend` service. See [notes on deploying workers](/admin/workers#deploying-workers) for additional details. Good initial values for CPU and memory resources allocated to this new service should match the `frontend` service.

## v3.27 ➔ v3.28

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v3.28.0`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.28.0/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.
- The memory requirements for `redis-cache` and `redis-store` have been increased by 1GB. See https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/pull/373 for more context.

## v3.26 ➔ v3.27

> WARNING: Sourcegraph 3.27 now requires **Postgres 12+**.

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v3.27.0`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.27.0/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.
- If you are using an external database, [upgrade your database](/admin/postgres#upgrading-external-postgresql-instances) to Postgres 12 or above prior to upgrading Sourcegraph. No action is required if you are using the supplied supplied database images.
- **If performing a multiversion upgrade from an instance prior to this version see our [upgrading early versions documentation](/admin/updates/migrator/upgrading-early-versions#before-v3270)**

## v3.25 ➔ v3.26

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v3.26.0`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.26.0/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.

## v3.24 ➔ v3.25

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v3.25.0`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.25.0/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.
- Go `1.15` introduced changes to SSL/TLS connection validation which requires certificates to include a `SAN`. This field was not included in older certificates and clients relied on the `CN` field. You might see an error like `x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field`. We recommend that customers using Sourcegraph with an external database and and connecting to it using SSL/TLS check whether the certificate is up to date.
    - AWS RDS customers please reference [AWS' documentation on updating the SSL/TLS certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html) for steps to rotate your certificate.

## v3.23 ➔ v3.24

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v3.24.0`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.24.0/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.

## v3.22 ➔ v3.23

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v3.23.0`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.23.0/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.

## v3.21 ➔ v3.22

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v3.22.0`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.22.0/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.
- This upgrade removes the `code intel bundle manager`. This service has been deprecated and all references to it have been removed.
- This upgrade also adds a MinIO container that doesn't require any custom configuration. You can find more detailed documentation [here](/admin/external_services/object_storage).

## v3.20 ➔ v3.21

#### Notes:

- Target the tag [`v3.21.1`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.21.1/docker-compose) when fetching upstream from `deploy-sourcegraph-docker`.
- This release introduces a second database instance, `codeintel-db`. If you have configured Sourcegraph with an external database, then update the `CODEINTEL_PG*` environment variables to point to a new external database as described in the [external database documentation](/admin/external_services/postgres). Again, these must not point to the same database or the Sourcegraph instance will refuse to start.
