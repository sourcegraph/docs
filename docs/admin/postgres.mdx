# PostgreSQL

Sourcegraph uses several PostgreSQL databases to support various functionality. These databases are:

- `pgsql` or `primary`: responsible for user data and account information
- `codeintel-db`: provides support for lsif data and part of the code-intelligence
- `codeinsights-db`: provides support for code insights data

## Version requirements

We support Postgres 16 and above. Older versions of Sourcegraph supported 12 see our [Postgres 12 deprecation notice](/admin/postgres12_end_of_life_notice) for more details.

## Role requirements

The user provided to Sourcegraph must have full access to the `sg` database and be able to create the following
extensions:

```
citext
hstore
intarray
pg_stat_statements
pg_trgm
pgcrypto
vector
```

### Upgrading Built-in PostgreSQL

Sourcegraph deployments come packaged with containers using the `postgresql-16` image for `pgsql` and `codeintel-db` deployments and `postgresql-16-codeinsights` for `codeinsights`. These images contain an entryscript which will detect and upgrade Postgres instances at version 12 (our previous images Postgres version). See the (Postgres 12 end of life notice)[/admin/prostgres12_end_of_life_notice#] for more details. 

> WARNING: Upgrading the PostgreSQL database requires stopping your Sourcegraph deployment which will result in **downtime**.
>
> Additionally, once the upgrade process is started via the database container, interrupting the container before the upgrade is complete could result in corrupting the underlying Postgres database. We strongly advise taking a backup before the upgrade. 

The `PG_UPGRADE_EXTRA_ARGS` env var can be set in the built-in `postgresql-16` and `postgresql-16-codeinsights` deployments to provide extra arguments to the `pg_upgrade` command. 

Setting the env var `PG_UPGRADE_EXTRA_ARGS=--link` provides the `--link` option to the underlying `pg_update`; creating a hard links between the old and new data directories instead of copying data. This option is faster and requires less disk space, however if the database containers are interrupted during the upgrade process there is a strong possibility of data corruption. This can still be a viable choice for users who are confident in their container scheduling and backups and would like to avoid longer downtimes.

If not using the `--link` option, you will need enough disk space available for Postgres to make a copy of the existing data. For example, if your database is currently using 100GiB of storage, you will need an additional 100GiB free space in order for the upgrade process to succeed.


### Upgrading external PostgreSQL instances

When running an [external PostgreSQL instance](/admin/external_services/postgres), please do the following:

1. Back up the Postgres DB so that you can restore to the old version should anything go wrong.
2. Turn off Sourcegraph entirely (bring down all containers and pods so they cannot talk to Postgres.)
3. Upgrade Postgres to the latest version following your provider's instruction or your preferred method:
  - [AWS RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.PostgreSQL.html)
  - [AWS Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Upgrading.html)
  - [GCP CloudSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/db-versions)
  - [Azure DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/concepts-supported-versions#managing-updates-and-upgrades)
  - [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/upgrading-heroku-postgres-databases)
  - [EnterpriseDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/en/9.6/pg/upgrading.html)
  - [Citus](http://docs.citusdata.com/en/v8.1/admin_guide/upgrading_citus.html)
  - [Aiven PostgreSQL](https://aiven.io/docs/platform/concepts/maintenance-window#related-pages)
  - [Your own PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/pgupgrade.html)
4. Turn Sourcegraph back on connecting to the now-upgraded database.

> WARNING: **Do not allow Sourcegraph to run/connect to the new Postgres database until it has been fully populated with your data.** Doing so could result in Sourcegraph trying to create e.g. a new DB schema and partially migrating. If this happens to you, restore from the backup you previously took or contact us (support@sourcegraph.com)

#### Single-container Sourcegraph

Sourcegraph Single-container is not a supported production deployment and currently doesn't support upgrades to Postgres 16. Admins with production data in a single container deployment are advised to reach out to support@sourcegraph.com for assistance.
