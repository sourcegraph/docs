# PostgreSQL

Sourcegraph uses several PostgreSQL databases to support various functionality. These databases are:

- `pgsql` or `primary`: responsible for user data and account information
- `codeintel-db`: provides support for lsif data and part of the code-intelligence
- `codeinsights-db`: provides support for code insights data

## Version requirements

We support Postgres 16 and above. Older versions of Sourcegraph supported 12 see our [Postgres 12 deprecation notice](/admin/postgres12_end_of_life_notice) for more details. Starting in Sourcegraph 6.0.0, sourcegraph services will no longer connect to a PostgreSQL 12 or lower database. Instead displaying an error message in container logs for services attempting to connect to a PostgreSQL database below version 16.

## Role requirements

The user provided to Sourcegraph must have full access to the `sg` database and be able to create the following
extensions:

```
citext
hstore
intarray
pg_stat_statements
pg_trgm
pgcrypto
vector
```

### Upgrading Built-in PostgreSQL

Starting in version `5.10.0`, Sourcegraph begins supporting PostgreSQL 16. For admins deploying our built-in PostgreSQL, we facilitate the upgrade of PostgreSQL using entrypoint scripts packaged in the new `postgresql-16` and `postgresql-16-codeinsights` container images which become standard in our deployment repos in `5.10.0`. The database container images are renamed as follows:

**postgres-12-alpine → postgresql-16**

**codeintel-db → postgresql-16**

**codeinsights-db → postgresql-16-codeinsights**

> WARNING: Upgrading the PostgreSQL database requires stopping your Sourcegraph deployment which will result in **downtime**.
>
> Once the database upgrade process is started, containers running the upgrade should not be stopped or restarted.

When our `postgresql-16` images start, if they detect a PostgresSQL 12 database in their attached volume, they will automatically attempt to upgrade the database to PostgreSQL 16.

We have the following advisements to admins:
- Container orchestration management systems (e.g. Kubernetes) may restart containers at any time, **it is recommended that you take a backup of your database before starting the upgrade process.**
- Review your deployment types [upgrade notes](/admin/updates#upgrades-index) before upgrading. The PostgreSQL upgrade process mutates the database schema in a way that may Sourcegraph `v5.10.0` and `v5.11.0` may not recognize. [Learn more about pg12 to pg16 schema drift here](/admin/how-to/postgres_12_to_16_drift).

#### Upgrade entryscript `--link` option

The `PG_UPGRADE_EXTRA_ARGS` env var can be set in the built-in `postgresql-16` and `postgresql-16-codeinsights` deployments to provide extra arguments to the `pg_upgrade` command. 

Setting the env var `PG_UPGRADE_EXTRA_ARGS=--link` provides the `--link` option to the underlying `pg_update`; creating a hard links between the old and new data directories instead of copying data. This option is faster and requires less disk space, however if the database containers are interrupted during the upgrade process there is a strong possibility of data corruption. This can still be a viable choice for users who are confident in their container scheduling and backups and would like to avoid longer downtimes.

If not using the `--link` option, you will need enough disk space available for Postgres to make a copy of the existing data. For example, if your database is currently using 100GiB of storage, you will need an additional 100GiB free space in order for the upgrade process to succeed.


### Upgrading external PostgreSQL instances

When running an [external PostgreSQL instance](/admin/external_services/postgres), please do the following:

1. Back up the Postgres DB so that you can restore to the old version should anything go wrong.
2. Turn off Sourcegraph entirely (bring down all containers and pods so they cannot talk to Postgres.)
3. Upgrade Postgres to the latest version following your provider's instruction or your preferred method:
  - [AWS RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.PostgreSQL.html)
  - [AWS Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Upgrading.html)
  - [GCP CloudSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/db-versions)
  - [Azure DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/concepts-supported-versions#managing-updates-and-upgrades)
  - [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/upgrading-heroku-postgres-databases)
  - [EnterpriseDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/en/9.6/pg/upgrading.html)
  - [Citus](http://docs.citusdata.com/en/v8.1/admin_guide/upgrading_citus.html)
  - [Aiven PostgreSQL](https://aiven.io/docs/platform/concepts/maintenance-window#related-pages)
  - [Your own PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/pgupgrade.html)
4. Turn Sourcegraph back on connecting to the now-upgraded database.

> WARNING: **Do not allow Sourcegraph to run/connect to the new Postgres database until it has been fully populated with your data.** Doing so could result in Sourcegraph trying to create e.g. a new DB schema and partially migrating. If this happens to you, restore from the backup you previously took or contact us (support@sourcegraph.com)

#### Single-container Sourcegraph

Sourcegraph Single-container is not a supported production deployment and currently doesn't support upgrades to Postgres 16. Admins with production data in a single container deployment are advised to reach out to support@sourcegraph.com for assistance.
