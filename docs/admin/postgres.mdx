# PostgreSQL

Sourcegraph uses several PostgreSQL databases to support various functionality. These databases are:

- `pgsql` or `primary`: responsible for user data and account information
- `codeintel-db`: provides support for lsif data and part of the code-intelligence
- `codeinsights-db`: provides support for code insights data

## Requirements

### Version requirements

We support Postgres 16 and above. Older versions of Sourcegraph supported 12 see our [Postgres 12 deprecation notice](/admin/postgres12_end_of_life_notice) for more details. Starting in Sourcegraph 6.0.0, sourcegraph services will no longer connect to a PostgreSQL 12 or lower database. Instead, it will display an error message in container logs for services attempting to connect to a PostgreSQL database below version 16.
```
migrator  | ✱ Sourcegraph migrator 6.0.0
migrator  | ⚠️ Failed to check for migrator update: unexpected status code 404. Continuing...
migrator  | Attempting connection to frontend...
migrator  | {"SeverityText":"FATAL","Timestamp":1738107940979396426,"InstrumentationScope":"migrator","Caller":"migrator/main.go:24","Function":"main.main","Body":"new db handle: Sourcegraph requires PostgreSQL 16+. For more information about PostgreSQL requirements and upgrade guides, visit https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/postgres","Resource":{"service.name":"migrator","service.version":"6.0.0","service.instance.id":"23097a97-50f4-4b42-80b5-83802baffeb4"},"Attributes":{}}
migrator exited with code 1
```

Sourcegraph services attempting to connect to a database running Postgres 12 or less will display the following error message:
```
"new db handle: Sourcegraph requires PostgreSQL 16+. For more information about PostgreSQL requirements and upgrade guides, visit https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/postgres"
```

See [below](#upgrading-postgresql) for more details about how to upgrade your PostgreSQL database.

### Role requirements

The user provided to Sourcegraph must have full access to the `sg` database and be able to create the following
extensions:

```
citext
hstore
intarray
pg_stat_statements
pg_trgm
pgcrypto
vector
```

## Configuring PostgreSQL

Sourcegraph databases come preconfigured, however admins may make custom configurations as needed. For more information see our [configuration docs](/admin/config/postgres-conf).

## Upgrading PostgreSQL

### Upgrading Built-in PostgreSQL

In Sourcegraph 5.10.0, we've upgraded our builtin database images to PostgreSQL 16.

Database Image Updates:
- `postgres-12` is now `postgresql-16`
- `codeintel-db` is now `postgresql-16`
- `codeinsights-db` is now `postgresql-16-codeinsights`

These images contain an entry script that will detect and upgrade Postgres instances from version 12 (the version in our previous images) to Postgres 16.

> WARNING: Upgrading the PostgreSQL database requires stopping your Sourcegraph deployment which will result in **downtime**.
>
> Additionally, once the upgrade process is started via the database container, interrupting the container before the upgrade is complete could result in corrupting the underlying Postgres database. **We strongly advise taking a backup before the upgrade.**

**For instance specfic instructions on how to upgrade a builtin Postgres database via the image entrypoint script, see [our instance specific operational instructions](/admin/how-to/upgrade-postgres-12-16-builtin-dbs).**

We have the following advisements to admins:
- Container orchestration management systems (e.g. Kubernetes) may restart containers at any time, **it is recommended that you take a backup of your database before starting the upgrade process.**
- Review your deployment types [upgrade notes](/admin/updates#upgrades-index) before upgrading. The PostgreSQL upgrade process mutates the database schema in a way that may Sourcegraph `v5.10.0` and `v5.11.0` may not recognize. [Learn more about pg12 to pg16 schema drift here](/admin/how-to/postgres_12_to_16_drift).

For additional assistance with PostgreSQL upgrades, please contact support@sourcegraph.com.

### Upgrade entrypoint script options

The `PG_UPGRADE_EXTRA_ARGS` environment variable allows you to customize the `pg_upgrade` command in `postgresql-16` and `postgresql-16-codeinsights` deployments.

- **Quick upgrade option:**
Setting `PG_UPGRADE_EXTRA_ARGS=--link` creates hard links between old and new data directories instead of copying data. While faster and space-efficient, this method risks data corruption if containers are interrupted during an upgrade. It is best used when you have reliable container scheduling and solid backups.

- **Storage requirements:**
Without `--link`, you'll need double the current database size in free disk space. For example, a 100GiB database requires an additional 100GiB free space for the upgrade.

### Upgrading external PostgreSQL instances

When running an [external PostgreSQL instance](/admin/external_services/postgres), please do the following:

1. Back up the Postgres DB so that you can restore to the old version should anything go wrong.
2. Turn off Sourcegraph entirely (bring down all containers and pods so they cannot talk to Postgres.)
3. Upgrade Postgres to the latest version following your provider's instruction or your preferred method:
  - [AWS RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.PostgreSQL.html)
  - [AWS Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Upgrading.html)
  - [GCP CloudSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/db-versions)
  - [Azure DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/concepts-supported-versions#managing-updates-and-upgrades)
  - [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/upgrading-heroku-postgres-databases)
  - [EnterpriseDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/en/9.6/pg/upgrading.html)
  - [Citus](http://docs.citusdata.com/en/v8.1/admin_guide/upgrading_citus.html)
  - [Aiven PostgreSQL](https://aiven.io/docs/platform/concepts/maintenance-window#related-pages)
  - [Your own PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/pgupgrade.html)
4. Turn Sourcegraph back on connecting to the now-upgraded database.

> WARNING: **Do not allow Sourcegraph to run/connect to the new Postgres database until it has been fully populated with your data.** Doing so could result in Sourcegraph trying to create e.g. a new DB schema and partially migrating. If this happens to you, restore from the backup you previously took or contact us (support@sourcegraph.com)

#### Single-container Sourcegraph

Sourcegraph Single-container is not a supported production deployment and currently doesn't support upgrades to Postgres 16. Admins with production data in a single container deployment are advised to reach out to support@sourcegraph.com for assistance.
