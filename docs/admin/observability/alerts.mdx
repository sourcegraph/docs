## frontend: 99th_percentile_search_request_duration

<p class="subtitle">99th percentile successful search request duration over 5m</p>

**Descriptions**

- <span class="badge badge-warning">warning</span> frontend: 20s+ 99th percentile successful search request duration over 5m

**Next steps**

- **Get details on the exact queries that are slow** by configuring `"observability.logSlowSearches": 20,` in the site configuration and looking for `frontend` warning logs prefixed with `slow search request` for additional details.
- **Check that most repositories are indexed** by visiting https://sourcegraph.example.com/site-admin/repositories?filter=needs-index (it should show few or no results.)
- **Kubernetes:** Check CPU usage of zoekt-webserver in the indexed-search pod, consider increasing CPU limits in the `indexed-search.Deployment.yaml` if regularly hitting max CPU utilization.
- **Docker Compose:** Check CPU usage on the Zoekt Web Server dashboard, consider increasing `cpus:` of the zoekt-webserver container in `docker-compose.yml` if regularly hitting max CPU utilization.
- Learn more about the related dashboard panel in the [dashboards reference](dashboards#frontend-99th-percentile-search-request-duration).
- **Silence this alert:** If you are aware of this alert and want to silence notifications for it, add the following to your site configuration and set a reminder to re-evaluate the alert:

```json
"observability.silenceAlerts": [
  "warning_frontend_99th_percentile_search_request_duration"

**Next steps**

- On a warning alert, you may want to provision more disk space: Disk pressure may result in decreased performance, users having to wait for repositories to clone, etc.
- On a critical alert, you need to provision more disk space. Running out of disk space will result in decreased performance, or complete service outage.

- **Single container deployments:** Consider upgrading to a [Docker Compose deployment](../deploy/docker-compose/migrate) which offers better scalability and resource isolation.

- <span class="badge badge-critical">critical</span> zoekt: 80%+ process memory map areas percentage used (per instance)

**Next steps**

- If you are running out of memory map areas, you could resolve this by:

    - Enabling shard merging for Zoekt: Set SRC_ENABLE_SHARD_MERGING="1" for zoekt-indexserver. Use this option
if your corpus of repositories has a high percentage of small, rarely updated repositories. See
[documentation](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/code-search/features#shard-merging).
    - Creating additional Zoekt replicas: This spreads all the shards out amongst more replicas, which
means that each _individual_ replica will have fewer shards. This, in turn, decreases the
amount of memory map areas that a _single_ replica can create (in order to load the shards into memory).
    - Increasing the virtual memory subsystem`s "max_map_count" parameter which defines the upper limit of memory areas
a process can use. The default value of max_map_count is usually 65536. We recommend to set this value to 2x the number
of repos to be indexed per Zoekt instance. This means, if you want to index 240k repositories with 3 Zoekt instances,
set max_map_count to (240000 / 3) * 2 = 160000. The exact instructions for tuning this parameter can differ depending
on your environment. See https://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt for more information.

**Next steps**

- Check the "number of events exported per batch over 30m" dashboard panel to see if export throughput is at saturation.
- Increase `TELEMETRY_GATEWAY_EXPORTER_EXPORT_BATCH_SIZE` to export more events per batch.
- Reduce `TELEMETRY_GATEWAY_EXPORTER_EXPORT_INTERVAL` to schedule more export jobs.
- See worker logs in the `worker.telemetrygateway-exporter` log scope for more details to see if any export errors are occuring - if logs only indicate that exports failed, reach out to Sourcegraph with relevant log entries, as this may be an issue in Sourcegraph`s Telemetry Gateway service.
