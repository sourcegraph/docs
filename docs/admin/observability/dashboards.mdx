#### frontend: zoekt_configuration_grpc_clients_internal_error_percentage_all_methods

<p class="subtitle">Client-observed gRPC internal error percentage across all methods over 2m</p>

The percentage of gRPC requests that appear to fail due to gRPC internal errors across all methods, aggregated across all "zoekt_configuration" clients.

**Note**: Internal errors are ones that appear to originate from the https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go library itself, rather than from any user-written application code. These errors can be caused by a variety of issues, and can originate from either the code-generated "zoekt_configuration" gRPC client or gRPC server. These errors might be solvable by adjusting the gRPC configuration, or they might indicate a bug from Sourcegraph`s use of gRPC.

When debugging, knowing that a particular error comes from the grpc-go library itself (an `internal error`) as opposed to `normal` application code can be helpful when trying to fix it.

**Note**: Internal errors are detected via a very coarse heuristic (seeing if the error starts with `grpc:`, etc.). Because of this, it`s possible that some gRPC-specific issues might not be categorized as internal errors.

#### frontend: internal_api_grpc_clients_internal_error_percentage_all_methods

<p class="subtitle">Client-observed gRPC internal error percentage across all methods over 2m</p>

The percentage of gRPC requests that appear to fail due to gRPC internal errors across all methods, aggregated across all "internal_api" clients.

**Note**: Internal errors are ones that appear to originate from the https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go library itself, rather than from any user-written application code. These errors can be caused by a variety of issues, and can originate from either the code-generated "internal_api" gRPC client or gRPC server. These errors might be solvable by adjusting the gRPC configuration, or they might indicate a bug from Sourcegraph`s use of gRPC.

When debugging, knowing that a particular error comes from the grpc-go library itself (an `internal error`) as opposed to `normal` application code can be helpful when trying to fix it.

**Note**: Internal errors are detected via a very coarse heuristic (seeing if the error starts with `grpc:`, etc.). Because of this, it`s possible that some gRPC-specific issues might not be categorized as internal errors.

### Frontend: Container monitoring (not available on server)

#### frontend: container_missing

<p class="subtitle">Container missing</p>

This value is the number of times a container has not been seen for more than one minute. If you observe this
value change independent of deployment events (such as an upgrade), it could indicate pods are being OOM killed or terminated for some other reasons.

- **Kubernetes:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `kubectl describe pod (frontend\|sourcegraph-frontend)` (look for `OOMKilled: true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit in the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `kubectl logs -p (frontend\|sourcegraph-frontend)`.
- **Docker Compose:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `docker inspect -f '\{\{json .State\}\}' (frontend\|sourcegraph-frontend)` (look for `"OOMKilled":true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit of the (frontend|sourcegraph-frontend) container in `docker-compose.yml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `docker logs (frontend\|sourcegraph-frontend)` (note this will include logs from the previous and currently running container).

#### gitserver: gitserver_grpc_clients_internal_error_percentage_all_methods

<p class="subtitle">Client-observed gRPC internal error percentage across all methods over 2m</p>

The percentage of gRPC requests that appear to fail due to gRPC internal errors across all methods, aggregated across all "gitserver" clients.

**Note**: Internal errors are ones that appear to originate from the https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go library itself, rather than from any user-written application code. These errors can be caused by a variety of issues, and can originate from either the code-generated "gitserver" gRPC client or gRPC server. These errors might be solvable by adjusting the gRPC configuration, or they might indicate a bug from Sourcegraph`s use of gRPC.

When debugging, knowing that a particular error comes from the grpc-go library itself (an `internal error`) as opposed to `normal` application code can be helpful when trying to fix it.

**Note**: Internal errors are detected via a very coarse heuristic (seeing if the error starts with `grpc:`, etc.). Because of this, it`s possible that some gRPC-specific issues might not be categorized as internal errors.

#### gitserver: gitserver_grpc_clients_internal_error_percentage_per_method

<p class="subtitle">Client-observed gRPC internal error percentage per-method over 2m</p>

The percentage of gRPC requests that appear to fail to due to gRPC internal errors per method, aggregated across all "gitserver" clients.

**Note**: Internal errors are ones that appear to originate from the https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go library itself, rather than from any user-written application code. These errors can be caused by a variety of issues, and can originate from either the code-generated "gitserver" gRPC client or gRPC server. These errors might be solvable by adjusting the gRPC configuration, or they might indicate a bug from Sourcegraph`s use of gRPC.

When debugging, knowing that a particular error comes from the grpc-go library itself (an `internal error`) as opposed to `normal` application code can be helpful when trying to fix it.

**Note**: Internal errors are detected via a very coarse heuristic (seeing if the error starts with `grpc:`, etc.). Because of this, it`s possible that some gRPC-specific issues might not be categorized as internal errors.

This panel has no related alerts.

### Git Server: Container monitoring (not available on server)

#### gitserver: container_missing

<p class="subtitle">Container missing</p>

This value is the number of times a container has not been seen for more than one minute. If you observe this
value change independent of deployment events (such as an upgrade), it could indicate pods are being OOM killed or terminated for some other reasons.

- **Kubernetes:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `kubectl describe pod gitserver` (look for `OOMKilled: true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit in the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `kubectl logs -p gitserver`.
- **Docker Compose:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `docker inspect -f '\{\{json .State\}\}' gitserver` (look for `"OOMKilled":true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit of the gitserver container in `docker-compose.yml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `docker logs gitserver` (note this will include logs from the previous and currently running container).

### Precise Code Intel Worker: Container monitoring (not available on server)

#### precise-code-intel-worker: container_missing

<p class="subtitle">Container missing</p>

This value is the number of times a container has not been seen for more than one minute. If you observe this
value change independent of deployment events (such as an upgrade), it could indicate pods are being OOM killed or terminated for some other reasons.

- **Kubernetes:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `kubectl describe pod precise-code-intel-worker` (look for `OOMKilled: true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit in the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `kubectl logs -p precise-code-intel-worker`.
- **Docker Compose:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `docker inspect -f '\{\{json .State\}\}' precise-code-intel-worker` (look for `"OOMKilled":true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit of the precise-code-intel-worker container in `docker-compose.yml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `docker logs precise-code-intel-worker` (note this will include logs from the previous and currently running container).

### Worker: Container monitoring (not available on server)

#### worker: container_missing

<p class="subtitle">Container missing</p>

This value is the number of times a container has not been seen for more than one minute. If you observe this
value change independent of deployment events (such as an upgrade), it could indicate pods are being OOM killed or terminated for some other reasons.

- **Kubernetes:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `kubectl describe pod worker` (look for `OOMKilled: true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit in the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `kubectl logs -p worker`.
- **Docker Compose:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `docker inspect -f '\{\{json .State\}\}' worker` (look for `"OOMKilled":true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit of the worker container in `docker-compose.yml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `docker logs worker` (note this will include logs from the previous and currently running container).

#### repo-updater: repo_updater_grpc_clients_internal_error_percentage_all_methods

<p class="subtitle">Client-observed gRPC internal error percentage across all methods over 2m</p>

The percentage of gRPC requests that appear to fail due to gRPC internal errors across all methods, aggregated across all "repo_updater" clients.

**Note**: Internal errors are ones that appear to originate from the https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go library itself, rather than from any user-written application code. These errors can be caused by a variety of issues, and can originate from either the code-generated "repo_updater" gRPC client or gRPC server. These errors might be solvable by adjusting the gRPC configuration, or they might indicate a bug from Sourcegraph`s use of gRPC.

When debugging, knowing that a particular error comes from the grpc-go library itself (an `internal error`) as opposed to `normal` application code can be helpful when trying to fix it.

**Note**: Internal errors are detected via a very coarse heuristic (seeing if the error starts with `grpc:`, etc.). Because of this, it`s possible that some gRPC-specific issues might not be categorized as internal errors.

### Repo Updater: Container monitoring (not available on server)

#### repo-updater: container_missing

<p class="subtitle">Container missing</p>

This value is the number of times a container has not been seen for more than one minute. If you observe this
value change independent of deployment events (such as an upgrade), it could indicate pods are being OOM killed or terminated for some other reasons.

- **Kubernetes:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `kubectl describe pod repo-updater` (look for `OOMKilled: true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit in the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `kubectl logs -p repo-updater`.
- **Docker Compose:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `docker inspect -f '\{\{json .State\}\}' repo-updater` (look for `"OOMKilled":true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit of the repo-updater container in `docker-compose.yml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `docker logs repo-updater` (note this will include logs from the previous and currently running container).

This graph is the average number of requests per second searcher is

The code is the HTTP Status code. 200 is success. We have a special code
"canceled" which is common when doing a large search request and we find
enough results before searching all possible repos.

Note: A search query is translated into an unindexed search query per unique

### Searcher: Cache store

#### searcher: store_fetching

<p class="subtitle">Amount of in-flight unindexed search requests fetching code from gitserver (per instance)</p>

Before we can search a commit we fetch the code from gitserver then cache it
for future search requests. This graph is the current number of search
requests which are in the state of fetching code from gitserver.

Generally this number should remain low since fetching code is fast, but
expect bursts. In the case of instances with a monorepo you would expect this
number to stay low for the duration of fetching the code (which in some cases
can take many minutes).

### Searcher: Index use

#### searcher: searcher_hybrid_final_state_total

<p class="subtitle">Hybrid search final state over 10m</p>

This graph is about our interactions with the search index (zoekt) to help
complete unindexed search requests. Searcher will use indexed search for the
files that have not changed between the unindexed commit and the index.

This graph should mostly be "success". The next most common state should be
"search-canceled" which happens when result limits are hit or the user starts
a new search. Finally the next most common should be "diff-too-large", which
happens if the commit is too far from the indexed commit. Otherwise other
state should be rare and likely are a sign for further investigation.

Note: On sourcegraph.com "zoekt-list-missing" is also common due to it
indexing a subset of repositories. Otherwise every other state should occur
rarely.

For a full list of possible state see

Zoekt goes down. So occasional bursts can be expected, but if this graph is
regularly above 0 it is a sign for further investigation.

#### searcher: searcher_grpc_clients_internal_error_percentage_all_methods

<p class="subtitle">Client-observed gRPC internal error percentage across all methods over 2m</p>

The percentage of gRPC requests that appear to fail due to gRPC internal errors across all methods, aggregated across all "searcher" clients.

**Note**: Internal errors are ones that appear to originate from the https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go library itself, rather than from any user-written application code. These errors can be caused by a variety of issues, and can originate from either the code-generated "searcher" gRPC client or gRPC server. These errors might be solvable by adjusting the gRPC configuration, or they might indicate a bug from Sourcegraph`s use of gRPC.

When debugging, knowing that a particular error comes from the grpc-go library itself (an `internal error`) as opposed to `normal` application code can be helpful when trying to fix it.

**Note**: Internal errors are detected via a very coarse heuristic (seeing if the error starts with `grpc:`, etc.). Because of this, it`s possible that some gRPC-specific issues might not be categorized as internal errors.

### Searcher: Container monitoring (not available on server)

#### searcher: container_missing

<p class="subtitle">Container missing</p>

This value is the number of times a container has not been seen for more than one minute. If you observe this
value change independent of deployment events (such as an upgrade), it could indicate pods are being OOM killed or terminated for some other reasons.

- **Kubernetes:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `kubectl describe pod searcher` (look for `OOMKilled: true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit in the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `kubectl logs -p searcher`.
- **Docker Compose:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `docker inspect -f '\{\{json .State\}\}' searcher` (look for `"OOMKilled":true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit of the searcher container in `docker-compose.yml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `docker logs searcher` (note this will include logs from the previous and currently running container).

#### symbols: symbols_grpc_clients_internal_error_percentage_all_methods

<p class="subtitle">Client-observed gRPC internal error percentage across all methods over 2m</p>

The percentage of gRPC requests that appear to fail due to gRPC internal errors across all methods, aggregated across all "symbols" clients.

**Note**: Internal errors are ones that appear to originate from the https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go library itself, rather than from any user-written application code. These errors can be caused by a variety of issues, and can originate from either the code-generated "symbols" gRPC client or gRPC server. These errors might be solvable by adjusting the gRPC configuration, or they might indicate a bug from Sourcegraph`s use of gRPC.

When debugging, knowing that a particular error comes from the grpc-go library itself (an `internal error`) as opposed to `normal` application code can be helpful when trying to fix it.

**Note**: Internal errors are detected via a very coarse heuristic (seeing if the error starts with `grpc:`, etc.). Because of this, it`s possible that some gRPC-specific issues might not be categorized as internal errors.

### Symbols: Container monitoring (not available on server)

#### symbols: container_missing

<p class="subtitle">Container missing</p>

This value is the number of times a container has not been seen for more than one minute. If you observe this
value change independent of deployment events (such as an upgrade), it could indicate pods are being OOM killed or terminated for some other reasons.

- **Kubernetes:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `kubectl describe pod symbols` (look for `OOMKilled: true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit in the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `kubectl logs -p symbols`.
- **Docker Compose:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `docker inspect -f '\{\{json .State\}\}' symbols` (look for `"OOMKilled":true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit of the symbols container in `docker-compose.yml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `docker logs symbols` (note this will include logs from the previous and currently running container).

### Syntect Server: Container monitoring (not available on server)

#### syntect-server: container_missing

<p class="subtitle">Container missing</p>

This value is the number of times a container has not been seen for more than one minute. If you observe this
value change independent of deployment events (such as an upgrade), it could indicate pods are being OOM killed or terminated for some other reasons.

- **Kubernetes:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `kubectl describe pod syntect-server` (look for `OOMKilled: true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit in the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `kubectl logs -p syntect-server`.
- **Docker Compose:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `docker inspect -f '\{\{json .State\}\}' syntect-server` (look for `"OOMKilled":true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit of the syntect-server container in `docker-compose.yml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `docker logs syntect-server` (note this will include logs from the previous and currently running container).

Each ongoing search request starts its life as an interactive query. If it

If you have a high number of batch queries it is a sign there is a large load
of slow queries. Alternatively your systems are underprovisioned and normal

Each ongoing search request starts its life as an interactive query. If it
takes too long it becomes a batch query. Between state transitions it can be queued.

If you have a high number of batch queries it is a sign there is a large load
of slow queries. Alternatively your systems are underprovisioned and normal
search queries are taking too long.

### Zoekt: Virtual Memory Statistics

#### zoekt: memory_map_areas_percentage_used

<p class="subtitle">Process memory map areas percentage used (per instance)</p>

Processes have a limited about of memory map areas that they can use. In Zoekt, memory map areas
are mainly used for loading shards into memory for queries (via mmap). However, memory map areas
are also used for loading shared libraries, etc.

_See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file and the related articles for more information about memory maps._

Once the memory map limit is reached, the Linux kernel will prevent the process from creating any
additional memory map areas. This could cause the process to crash.

Refer to the [alerts reference](alerts#zoekt-memory-map-areas-percentage-used) for 2 alerts related to this panel.

#### zoekt: average_shard_merging_duration_success

<p class="subtitle">Average successful shard merging duration over 1 hour</p>

Average duration of a successful merge over the last hour.

The duration depends on the target compound shard size. The larger the compound shard the longer a merge will take.
Since the target compound shard size is set on start of zoekt-indexserver, the average duration should be consistent.

The percentage of gRPC requests that appear to fail due to gRPC internal errors across all methods, aggregated across all "zoekt_webserver" clients.

**Note**: Internal errors are ones that appear to originate from the https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go library itself, rather than from any user-written application code. These errors can be caused by a variety of issues, and can originate from either the code-generated "zoekt_webserver" gRPC client or gRPC server. These errors might be solvable by adjusting the gRPC configuration, or they might indicate a bug from Sourcegraph`s use of gRPC.

When debugging, knowing that a particular error comes from the grpc-go library itself (an `internal error`) as opposed to `normal` application code can be helpful when trying to fix it.

**Note**: Internal errors are detected via a very coarse heuristic (seeing if the error starts with `grpc:`, etc.). Because of this, it`s possible that some gRPC-specific issues might not be categorized as internal errors.

This panel has no related alerts.

### Zoekt: [zoekt-indexserver] Container monitoring (not available on server)

#### zoekt: container_missing

<p class="subtitle">Container missing</p>

This value is the number of times a container has not been seen for more than one minute. If you observe this
value change independent of deployment events (such as an upgrade), it could indicate pods are being OOM killed or terminated for some other reasons.

- **Kubernetes:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `kubectl describe pod zoekt-indexserver` (look for `OOMKilled: true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit in the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `kubectl logs -p zoekt-indexserver`.
- **Docker Compose:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `docker inspect -f '\{\{json .State\}\}' zoekt-indexserver` (look for `"OOMKilled":true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit of the zoekt-indexserver container in `docker-compose.yml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `docker logs zoekt-indexserver` (note this will include logs from the previous and currently running container).

### Prometheus: Container monitoring (not available on server)

#### prometheus: container_missing

<p class="subtitle">Container missing</p>

This value is the number of times a container has not been seen for more than one minute. If you observe this
value change independent of deployment events (such as an upgrade), it could indicate pods are being OOM killed or terminated for some other reasons.

- **Kubernetes:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `kubectl describe pod prometheus` (look for `OOMKilled: true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit in the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `kubectl logs -p prometheus`.
- **Docker Compose:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `docker inspect -f '\{\{json .State\}\}' prometheus` (look for `"OOMKilled":true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit of the prometheus container in `docker-compose.yml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `docker logs prometheus` (note this will include logs from the previous and currently running container).

#### executor: node_io_disk_utilization

<p class="subtitle">Disk IO utilization (percentage time spent in IO)</p>

However, a value of 100% does not necesarily indicate the disk is at max capacity. For single, serial request-serving devices, 100% may indicate maximum saturation, but for SSDs and RAID arrays this is less likely to be the case, as they are capable of serving multiple requests in parallel, other metrics such as throughput and request queue size should be factored in.

### OpenTelemetry Collector: Receivers

#### otel-collector: otel_span_receive_rate

<p class="subtitle">Spans received per receiver per minute</p>

Shows the rate of spans accepted by the configured reveiver

A Trace is a collection of spans and a span represents a unit of work or operation. Spans are the building blocks of Traces.
The spans have only been accepted by the receiver, which means they still have to move through the configured pipeline to be exported.
For more information on tracing and configuration of a OpenTelemetry receiver see https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/#receivers.

See the Exporters section see spans that have made it through the pipeline and are exported.

Depending the configured processors, received spans might be dropped and not exported. For more information on configuring processors see
https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/#processors.

### OpenTelemetry Collector: Container monitoring (not available on server)

#### otel-collector: container_missing

<p class="subtitle">Container missing</p>

This value is the number of times a container has not been seen for more than one minute. If you observe this
value change independent of deployment events (such as an upgrade), it could indicate pods are being OOM killed or terminated for some other reasons.

- **Kubernetes:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `kubectl describe pod otel-collector` (look for `OOMKilled: true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit in the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `kubectl logs -p otel-collector`.
- **Docker Compose:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `docker inspect -f '\{\{json .State\}\}' otel-collector` (look for `"OOMKilled":true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit of the otel-collector container in `docker-compose.yml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `docker logs otel-collector` (note this will include logs from the previous and currently running container).
