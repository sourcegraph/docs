# Executor secrets

Executor secrets can be used to define additional values to be used in Sourcegraph executors.

Secret values are currently only available in server-side batch changes. Use [`step.env`](/batch-changes/batch-spec-yaml-reference#stepsenv) to reference configured secrets in executions.

## How secrets work

Executor secrets are defined per-feature. If you want to define a secret for server-side batch changes, create a secret for that namespace (examples of namespaces are "Code Graph" and "Batch Changes"). Secrets are [encrypted](/admin/config/encryption) if encryption is on, and always redacted in log outputs.

There are two types of secrets:

-   **Global secrets**

    These secrets are defined by an admin in the site-admin interface and will be usable by every user on the Sourcegraph instance.

-   **Namespaced secrets**

    These secrets are set either in org or user settings and are only usable by the user or org members in their respective namespaces. For example, user-specific executor secrets apply only to batch changes within the user's namespace. If you've created a server-side batch spec under an organization or a different namespace, ensure the secret is defined under `/organizations/{org-namespace}/settings/executors/secrets`. If a namespaced secret has the same name as a global secret, the namespaced secret is preferred.

Examples:

-   Global secret `GITHUB_TOKEN`

    Can be used by every server-side batch change

-   User 1 secret `GITHUB_TOKEN`

    Can be used by batch changes created by user 1 in their own namespace, overwrites the global secret

-   Org 1 secret `GITHUB_TOKEN`

    Can be used by batch changes created by any org member of org 1 in the org namespace, overwrites the global secret

## Creating a new secret

To create a global secret, go to **Site-admin** > **Executors/Secrets** and click **Add secret**.
To create a user secret, go to your user profile from the navbar > **Settings** > **Executor secrets** and click **Add secret**.
To create an org secret, go to the org profile from the navbar > **Executor secrets** and click **Add secret**.

Then, fill in a name for the secret. This will be the name of the environment variable it will be accessible as.
Next, fill in the secret value and hit **Add secret**.

## Rotating a secret

To rotate a secret or to update the secret value, go to **Executor secrets** (see [Creating a new secret](#creating-a-new-secret)). Next to the secret you want to update or rotate click on **Update**. Fill in the new value and hit **Update secret**.

> Note: When updating secrets server-side batch changes execution caches that reference the secret will be invalidated.

## Removing a secret

To remove a secret, go to **Executor secrets** (see [Creating a new secret](#creating-a-new-secret)). Next to the secret you want to delete click on **Remove**.

> Note: When removing secrets server-side batch changes execution caches that reference the secret will be invalidated.
