# Deploying Sourcegraph executors using Docker Compose

<Callout type="note">
	This feature is in beta and might change in the future.
</Callout>

A [docker-compose file](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/master/docker-compose/executors/executor.docker-compose.yaml) is provided to deploy executors standlone, or alongside your existing Sourcegraph deployment.

## Requirements

Privileged containers are required to run executors in docker-compose. This is because executors require access to the docker daemon running on the host.

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

-   Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) on the server
-   Minimum Docker [v20.10.0](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/#20100) and Docker Compose [v1.29.0](https://docs.docker.com/compose/release-notes/#1290)
-   Docker Swarm mode is **not** supported
-   Clone the [deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker)
-   Edit the `deploy-sourcegraph-docker/docker-compose/executors/executor.docker-compose.yaml` and update the [environment variables](/admin/executors/executors_config)
-   Follow the instructions in the `README` for more specific deployment instructions.

## Note

Executors deployed via docker-compose do not use [Firecracker](/admin/executors/#how-it-works), meaning they require [privileged access](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities) to the docker daemon running on the host.

If you have security concerns, consider deploying via [terraform](/admin/executors/deploy_executors_terraform) or [installing the binary](/admin/executors/deploy_executors_binary) directly.
