# Deploying Sourcegraph Executors natively on Kubernetes

<Callout type="note">This feature is in beta and is available in Sourcegraph 5.1.0 and later.</Callout>

The native Kubernetes Executors have a master Executor pod that schedules worker pods via the Kubernetes API. The master Executor pod manages the lifecycle of jobs, while the worker pods process the actual [batch change](/batch_changes/explanations/server_side) or [precise auto indexing](/code-search/code-navigation/auto_indexing) job specs. For more details, see [how it works](/admin/executors#native-kubernetes).

## Requirements

Executors interact with the Kubernetes API to manage the lifecycle of individual executor jobs. The following are the RBAC Roles needed to run Executors natively on Kubernetes.

| API Groups |     Resources      |         Verbs          |                                          Reason                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `batch`    | `jobs`             | `create`, `delete`     | Executors create Job pods to run processes. Once Jobs are completed, they are cleaned up. |
|            | `pods`, `pods/log` | `get`, `list`, `watch` | Executors need to look up and steam logs from the Job Pods.                               |

See the [example Role YAML](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@main/-/blob/cmd/executor/kubernetes/batches/executor-batches.Role.yml) for more details on the exact RBAC requirements for native Kubernetes Executors.

## Deployment

Native Kubernetes Executors can be deployed via either the `sourcegraph-executor-k8s` [Helm chart](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/tree/main/charts/sourcegraph-executor/k8s) or by using the `executors/k8s` [Kustomize component](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-k8s/tree/main/components/executors/k8s).

### Steps

1. If you are deploying Executors for processing Batch Changes, set the `native-ssbc-execution` [feature flag](/admin/executors/native_execution#enable)
2. Configure the following environment variables on the Executor Deployment:
    1. `EXECUTOR_FRONTEND_URL` should match the URL of your Sourcegraph instance
    2. `EXECUTOR_FRONTEND_PASSWORD` should match the `executors.accessToken` key in the Sourcegraph instance's site configuration
    3. Either `EXECUTOR_QUEUE_NAMES` or `EXECUTOR_QUEUE_NAME` should be set depending on whether the Executor will process batch change or precise auto indexing jobs
    4. `EXECUTOR_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE` should be set to the Kubernetes namespace where you intend to run the worker pods. This should generally match the namesapce where you deploy the Executor resources in the next step.

    <Callout type="note">Additional environment variables may need to be configured for your Executors deployment. See [here](/admin/executors/executors_config) for a complete list.</Callout>

3. Deploy the native Kubernetes Executor resources to your Kubernetes cluster via either the `sourcegraph-executor-k8s` [Helm chart](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/tree/main/charts/sourcegraph-executor/k8s) or the `executors/k8s` [Kustomize component](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-k8s/tree/main/components/executors/k8s).
    1. For more details on how to work with the Sourcegraph Helm chart, see the [Helm chart docs](/admin/deploy/kubernetes#configuration) (_Note: The same Helm values `override.yaml` file can be used for both the main `sourcegraph` Helm chart as well as the `sourcegraph-executor-k8s` chart_)
    2. For more details on how to configure the `executors/k8s` component for your Kustomize deployment, see the [Kustomize configuration docs](/admin/deploy/kubernetes/configure#overview)
4. Once all the native Kubernetes Executor resources have been deployed to your cluster, confirm that the Executors are online by checking the _Executors_ page under **Site admin > Executors > Instances**

## Additional Notes

### Firecracker

Executors deployed on Kubernetes do not use [Firecracker](/admin/executors/#how-it-works).

If you have security concerns, consider deploying via [terraform](/admin/executors/deploy_executors_terraform)
or [installing the binary](/admin/executors/deploy_executors_binary) directly.

### Job Scheduling

> Note: Kubernetes has a max of 110 pods per node. If you run into this limit, you can lower the number of Job Pods running on a node by setting the environment variable `EXECUTOR_MAXIMUM_NUM_JOBS`.

Executors deployed on Kubernetes require Jobs to be scheduled on the same Node as the Executor. This is to ensure that
Jobs are able to access the same Persistence Volume as the Executor.

To ensure that Jobs are scheduled on the same Node as the Executor, the following environment variables can be set,

- `EXECUTOR_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME`
- `EXECUTOR_KUBERNETES_NODE_SELECTOR`
- `EXECUTOR_KUBERNETES_NODE_REQUIRED_AFFINITY_MATCH_EXPRESSIONS`
- `EXECUTOR_KUBERNETES_NODE_REQUIRED_AFFINITY_MATCH_FIELDS`

#### Node Name

Using the [Downward API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/downward-api/#downwardapi-fieldRef), the
property `spec.nodeName` can be used to set the `EXECUTOR_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME` environment variable.

```yaml
    - name: EXECUTOR_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: spec.nodeName
```

This ensures that the Job is scheduled on the same Node as the Executor.

However, if the node does not have enough resources to run the Job, the Job will not be scheduled.

### Firewall Rules

The following are Firewall rules that are _highly recommended_ when running Executors on Kubernetes in a Cloud
Environment.

- Disable access to internal resources.
- Disable access to `169.254.169.254` (AWS / GCP Instance Metadata Service).

### Batch Changes

To run [Batch Changes](/batch-changes/) on
Kubernetes, [native Server-Side Batch Changes](/admin/executors/native_execution) must be enabled.

### Docker Image

The Executor Docker image is available on Docker Hub at [`sourcegraph/executor-kubernetes`](https://hub.docker.com/r/sourcegraph/executor-kubernetes/tags).

### Example Configuration YAML

the [local development YAMLs](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@main/-/blob/cmd/executor/kubernetes)
