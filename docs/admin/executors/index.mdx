# Executors

Executors are Sourcegraph's solution for running untrusted code in a secure and controllable way. Executors provide a sandbox that can run resource-intensive or untrusted tasks on behalf of the Sourcegraph instance, such as:

- [Automatically indexing a repository for precise code navigation](/code-search/code-navigation/auto_indexing)
- [Running batch changes](/batch-changes/server-side)

## Installation

To deploy executors for your Sourcegraph instance, follow our [executor deployment guide](executors/deploy_executors).

## Why use executors?

Running untrusted code is a core requirement of features such as precise code navigation [auto-indexing](/code-search/code-navigation/auto_indexing), and [running batch changes server-side](/batch-changes/server-side).

Auto-indexing jobs, in particular, require the invocation of arbitrary and untrusted code to support the resolution of project dependencies. Invocation of post-install hooks, use of insecure [package management tools](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/29230), and package manager proxy attacks can create opportunities in which an adversary can gain unlimited use of compute or exfiltrate data. The latter outcome is particularly dangerous for on-premise installations of Sourcegraph, which is the chosen option for companies wanting to maintain strict privacy of their code property.

Instead of performing this work within the Sourcegraph instance, where code is available on disk and unprotected internal services are available over the local network, we move untrusted compute into a sandboxed environment, the _executor_, that has access only to the clone of a single repository on disk (its _workspace_) and to the public internet.

## Sandboxing Model

Executors can be deployed with [Firecracker](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker) isolation in accordance with our [sandboxing model](/admin/executors/#how-it-works) to isolate jobs from each other and the host.
This requires executors to be run on machines capable of running Linux KVM extensions. On the most popular cloud providers, this either means running executors on bare-metal machines (AWS) or machines capable of nested virtualization (GCP).

Optionally, executors can be run without using KVM-based isolation, which is less secure but might be easier to run on common machines.

## Deciding which executor deployment method to use

Deciding how to deploy the executor depends on your use case. For users that wish to process their untrusted compute in the most secure manner, we recommend leveraging the [Firecracker](./executors/firecracker) isolation method. For users that have constraints around running nested virtualization, the following flowchart can help you decide which deployment option is best for your environment:

## How it works

Executor instances are capable of being deployed in a variety of ways. Each runtime varies in _how_ jobs are executed.

### Locally with src-cli

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/executor_src_local_arch.png" alt="Executors architecture - local with src-cli" />


1.  User runs the `src` (e.g. `src batch`) command from the command line.
2.  `src` calls the Sourcegraph API to clone a repository.
    1.  The repositories are written to a directory.
3.  A Docker Container is created for each "step."
    1.  The directory containing the repository is mounted to the container.
    2.  "Steps" are ran in sequential order.
4.  The container run a defined command against the repository.
5.  Logs from the container are sent back to `src`.
6.  At the end of processing all repositories, the result is sent to a Sourcegraph API.
    1.  e.g. Batch Changes sends a `git diff` to a Sourcegraph API (and invokes other APIs).

### Binary


<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/executor_binary_arch.png" alt="Executors architecture - binary" />


1.  The executor binary is installed to a machine.
    1.  Additional executables (e.g. Docker, `src`) are installed as well
2.  The executor instances pulls for available Jobs from a Sourcegraph API
3.  A user initiates a process that creates executor Jobs.
4.  The executor instance "dequeues" a Job.
5.  Executor calls the Sourcegraph API to clone a repository.
    1. The repositories are written to a directory.
6.  A Docker Container is created for each "step."
    1.  If the Job is `batches` (non-native execution), `src` is invoked
    2.  Docker is invoked directly for other Jobs (`codeintel` and native execution `batches`)
    3.  The directory containing the repository is mounted to the container.
    4.  "Steps" are ran in sequential order.
7.  The container run a defined command against the repository.
8.  Logs from the container are sent back to the executor.
9.  Logs are streamed from the executor to a Sourcegraph API
10.  The executor calls a Sourcegraph API to that "complete" the Job.

### Firecracker
