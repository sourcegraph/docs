# Administration FAQ

## Does Sourcegraph support SVN?

For Subversion and other non-Git code hosts, the recommended way to make these accessible in
Sourcegraph is through [`src-expose`](/admin/code_hosts/other#experimental-src-expose).

Alternatively, you can use [`git-svn`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-svn) or
[`svg2git`](https://github.com/svn-all-fast-export/svn2git) to convert Subversion repositories to
Git repositories. Unlike `src-expose`, this will preserve commit history, but is generally much
slower.

## How do I access Sourcegraph if my authentication provider experiences an outage?

If you are using an external authentication provider and the provider experiences an outage, users
will be unable to sign into Sourcegraph. A site administrator can configure an alternate sign-in
method by modifying the `auth.providers` field in site configuration. However, the site
administrator may themselves be unable to sign in. If this is the case, then a site administrator
can update the configuration if they have direct `docker exec` or `kubectl exec` access to the
Sourcegraph instance. Follow the [instructions to update the site config if the web UI is
inaccessible](/admin/config/site_config#editing-your-site-configuration-if-you-cannot-access-the-web-ui).

## Sourcegraph is making unauthorized requests to the git server

This is normal and happens whenever git is used over HTTP. To avoid unnecessarily sending a password over HTTP, git first
makes a request without the password included. If a 401 Unauthorized is returned, git sends the request with the password.

More information can be found [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserverkb/two-401-responses-for-every-git-opperation-938854756.html).

If this behaviour is undesired, the `gitURLType` in the [external service configuration](/admin/code_hosts/github#configuration)
should be set to `ssh` instead of `http`. This will also require [ssh keys to be set up](/admin/repo/auth#repositories-that-need-http-s-or-ssh-authentication).

## Sourcegraph is not returning results from a repository unless "repo:" is included

If you can get repository results when you explicitly include `repo:{your repository}` in your search, but don't see any results from that repository when you don't, there are a few possible causes:

-   The repository is a fork repository (excluded from search results by default) and `fork:yes` is not specified in the search query.
-   The repository is an archived repository (excluded from search results by default) and `archived:yes` is not specified in the search query.
-   There is an issue indexing the repository: check the logs of worker and/or search-indexer.
-   The search index is unavailable for some reason: try the search query `repo:<the_repository> index:only`. If it returns no results, the repository has not been indexed.
