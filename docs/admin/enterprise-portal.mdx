## Accessing Sourcegraph Enterprise Portal

A [Sourcegraph Account](/sourcegraph-accounts) is required to access Sourcegraph Enterprise Portal. To manage a subscription a user must be added as a **Subscription admin** for the subscription.

## Subscription admin management

A subscription admin is a user with full access to the subscription in Enterprise Portal. Subscription admins can grant and revoke admin access to other users.

Users can be invited individually or in bulk. If there is no [Sourcegraph Account](/sourcegraph-accounts) associated with an invited user's email address an account will be created for them. Newly created users are sent an email with instructions to reset their password to access Enterprise Portal.

## Services

### Sourcegraph Analytics access

Subscription admins can view [Sourcegraph Analytics](/analytics) for the subscription.

### Deep Search usage monitoring

Site administrators can view their own [Deep Search](/deep-search) usage for the current quota period directly in the Enterprise Portal. This provides visibility into consumption relative to usage limits.

To access usage information, you must first [access the Enterprise Portal](#accessing-sourcegraph-enterprise-portal) as a subscription admin.
