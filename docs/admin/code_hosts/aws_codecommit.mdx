Site admins can sync Git repositories hosted on [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/) with Sourcegraph so that users can search and navigate the repositories.

To connect AWS CodeCommit to Sourcegraph:

1. Go to **Site admin > Manage code hosts > Add repositories**
1. Select **AWS CodeCommit repositories**.
1. Configure the connection to AWS CodeCommit using the action buttons above the text field, and additional fields can be added using `Cmd/Ctrl+Space` for auto-completion. See the [configuration documentation below](#configuration).
1. Press **Add repositories**.

## AWS CodeCommit Git credentials

Since version **3.4** of Sourcegraph, the AWS CodeCommit service **requires** [Git credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_ssh-keys.html#git-credentials-code-commit) in order to clone repositories via HTTPS. Git credentials consist of a username and a password that you can create in AWS IAM.

For detailed instructions on how to create the credentials in IAM, see: [Setup for HTTPS Users Using Git Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-gc.html)

<Callout type="info"> We don't plan to implement and support authentication roles for AWS CodeCommit such as IAM Roles, for example AssumeRole or IAM Anywhere. We encourage CodeCommit customers to continue Sourcegraph's provisions as shown in the schema below.</Callout>

## Configuration

AWS CodeCommit connections support the following configuration options, which are specified in the JSON editor in the site admin "Manage code hosts" area.

## Setup steps for SSH connections to AWS CodeCommit repositories

To add CodeCommit repositories in Docker Container:

1. Generate a public/private rsa key pair that does not require passphrase as listed in the [Step 3.1 of the AWS SSH setup guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-ssh-unixes.html#setting-up-ssh-unixes-keys). Sourcegraph does not work with the key pair that requires passphrase.
1. Follow the rest of the steps detailed in the [AWS SSH setup guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-ssh-unixes.html) to make sure you can connect to the code host locally.
1. Confirm you have the connection by running the following ssh command locally: `ssh git-codecommit.us-west-1.amazonaws.com` (Update link with your server region)
1. Confirm you can clone the repository locally.

### Configuring SSH credentials in the Web UI

```json
{
  "gitURLType": "ssh",
  "gitSSHKeyID": "<SSH key ID>",
  "gitSSHCredential": {
    // make sure the key is base64 encoded
    // $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa | base64
    "privateKey": "<base64 encoded of the SSH private key>",
    "passphrase": "<passphrase if applicable, omit if none is needed>"
  }
}
```
{/* SCHEMA_SYNC_END: admin/code_hosts/aws_codecommit.schema.json */}

## Configuration Notes

### Authentication Requirements
- AWS CodeCommit requires Git credentials (username/password) for HTTPS cloning
- IAM user must have `AWSCodeCommitReadOnly` policy attached
- Git credentials are generated through AWS IAM console

### Repository Discovery
- All repositories in the specified region are synced by default
- Use `exclude` to prevent specific repositories from being synced
- Supports exclusion by repository name or ARN

### Regional Configuration
- Each AWS region requires a separate code host connection
- Default region is `us-east-1` if not specified
- Ensure `repositoryPathPattern` includes region for uniqueness

## Security Considerations

### IAM and Access Management
- Use dedicated IAM users with minimal required permissions
- Git credentials are separate from AWS API keys
- Consider using IAM roles for EC2-hosted Sourcegraph instances (future enhancement)
- Regularly rotate Git credentials according to security policies

### Network Security
- Ensure Sourcegraph can access CodeCommit endpoints for your region
- HTTPS cloning uses port 443
- SSH cloning requires port 22 and key management

### Credential Storage
- Store Git credentials securely
- Use environment variables or secure secret management
- Avoid committing credentials to configuration files

## Common Examples

### Basic HTTPS Configuration
```json
{
  "region": "us-west-2",
  "accessKeyID": "AKIA...",
  "secretAccessKey": "secret-key",
  "gitCredentials": {
    "username": "git-username",
    "password": "git-password"
  },
  "repositoryPathPattern": "codecommit-{region}/{name}"
}
```

### Multi-Region Setup
```json
{
  "region": "eu-central-1",
  "accessKeyID": "AKIA...",
  "secretAccessKey": "secret-key", 
  "gitCredentials": {
    "username": "git-username",
    "password": "git-password"
  },
  "repositoryPathPattern": "git-codecommit.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/{name}",
  "exclude": [
    {"name": "legacy-repo"},
    {"id": "arn:aws:codecommit:eu-central-1:123456789012:archive-repo"}
  ]
}
```

### SSH Configuration
```json
{
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "accessKeyID": "AKIA...",
  "secretAccessKey": "secret-key",
  "gitURLType": "ssh",
  "gitSSHKeyID": "ssh-key-id",
  "gitSSHCredential": {
    "privateKey": "base64-encoded-private-key",
    "passphrase": "optional-passphrase"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Setup and Configuration
- Create dedicated IAM users for Sourcegraph integration
- Use meaningful `repositoryPathPattern` to avoid naming conflicts
- Configure separate connections for different AWS regions
- Test connections with a small set of repositories first

### Security
- Follow AWS IAM best practices for access keys
- Use Git credentials with appropriate scope limitations
- Implement regular credential rotation schedules
- Monitor CloudTrail logs for CodeCommit access patterns

### Performance
- Use exclude patterns to limit repository scope
- Consider repository size when planning sync schedules
- Monitor AWS service limits and quotas
- Plan for regional latency considerations

### Maintenance
- Keep IAM policies updated with AWS service changes
- Monitor for deprecated authentication methods
- Plan migration strategies for future IAM role support
- Regularly review repository inclusion/exclusion patterns

### Mounting SSH keys into the container

1. Copy all the files at your `$HOME/.ssh directory` to `$HOME/.sourcegraph/config/ssh` directory. See [docs](/admin/deploy/docker-single-container/#ssh-authentication-config-keys-knownhosts) for more information about our ssh file system.
    1. Read our [guide here](/admin/deploy/docker-compose/#git-ssh-configuration) for Docker Compose deployments
    1. Read our [guide here](/admin/deploy/kubernetes/configure#ssh-for-cloning) for Kubernetes deployments
1. Start (or restart) the container.
1. Connect Sourcegraph to AWS CodeCommit by going to **Sourcegraph > Site Admin > Manage code hosts > Generic Git host** and add the following:

```json
"url": "ssh://git-codecommit.us-west-1.amazonaws.com", //Please replace the 'us-east-1' region with yours
  "repos": [
    "v1/repos/REPO_NAME_1",
    "v1/repos/REPO_NAME_2",
  ]
```
