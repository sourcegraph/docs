Site admins can sync Git repositories hosted on [Bitbucket Cloud](https://bitbucket.org) with Sourcegraph so that users can search and navigate the repositories.

To connect Bitbucket Cloud to Sourcegraph:

1. Go to **Site admin > Manage code hosts > Add repositories**.
2. Select **Bitbucket.org**.
3. Configure the connection to Bitbucket Cloud using the action buttons above the text field. Additional fields can be added using <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl+Space</kbd> for auto-completion. See the [configuration documentation below](#configuration).
4. Press **Add repositories**.

## Repository syncing

Currently, all repositories belonging to the user configured will be synced.

In addition, there is one more field for configuring which repositories are mirrored:

- [`teams`](/admin/code_hosts/bitbucket_cloud#configuration)
  A list of teams (workspaces) that the configured user has access to whose repositories should be synced.
- [`exclude`](/admin/code_hosts/bitbucket_cloud#configuration)
  A list of repositories to exclude, which takes precedence over the `teams` field.

## Configuration options

Bitbucket Cloud code host connections can be configured with either a username and app password combination, or with workspace access tokens.

### Username and app password

1. Visit your [Bitbucket account settings page](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings).
2. Navigate to **App passwords**.
3. Select **Create app password**.
4. Give your app password a label.
5. Select the `Projects: Read` permission. `Repositories: Read` should automatically be selected.
6. Press **Create**.

Use the newly created app password and your username to configure the Bitbucket Cloud connection:

```json
{
  "url": "https://bitbucket.org",
  "username": "USERNAME",
  "appPassword": "<PASSWORD>",
  // ... other settings
}
```

### Workspace access token

1. Visit the Bitbucket Cloud workspace settings page of the workspace you want to create an access token for.
2. Navigate to **Security > Access tokens**.
3. Press **Create workspace access token**.
4. Give your access token a name.
5. Select the `Projects: Read` permission. `Repositories: Read` should automatically be selected.
6. Press **Create**.

Use the newly created access token to configure the Bitbucket Cloud connection:

```json
{
  "url": "https://bitbucket.org",
  "accessToken": "ACCESS_TOKEN",
  // ... other settings
}
```

### HTTPS cloning

Sourcegraph clones repositories from your Bitbucket Cloud via HTTP(S), using the [`username`](/admin/code_hosts/bitbucket_cloud#configuration) and [`appPassword`](/admin/code_hosts/bitbucket_cloud#configuration) required fields you provide in the configuration.

## Rate limits

Read about how Bitbucket Cloud applies rate limits [here](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/api-request-limits/).

When Sourcegraph encounters rate limits on Bitbucket Cloud, it will retry the request with exponential back-off, until 5 minutes have passed. If the connection is still being rate limited after 5 minutes, the request will be dropped.

### Internal rate limits

See [Internal rate limits](/admin/code_hosts/rate_limits#internal-rate-limits)

## User authentication

To configure Bitbucket Cloud as an authentication provider (which will enable sign-in via Bitbucket Cloud), see the
[authentication documentation](/admin/auth/#bitbucket-cloud).

## Repository permissions

Prerequisite: [Add Bitbucket Cloud as an authentication provider](#user-authentication).

Then, add or edit a Bitbucket Cloud connection as described above and include the `authorization` field:

```json
{
  // The URL used to set up the Bitbucket Cloud authentication provider must match this URL.
  "url": "https://bitbucket.com",
  "username": "horsten",
  "appPassword": "$APP_PASSWORD",
  // ...
  "authorization": {}
}
```

> NOTE: It can take some time to complete full cycle of repository permissions sync if you have a large number of users or repositories. [See sync duration time](/admin/permissions/syncing#sync-duration) for more information.

## Configuration

Bitbucket Cloud connections support the following configuration options, which are specified in the JSON editor in the site admin "Manage code hosts" area.

## Configuration Notes

### Authentication Methods
Bitbucket Cloud supports two authentication approaches:
- **Username and App Password**: Standard user credentials with application-specific password
- **Workspace Access Token**: OAuth-based token scoped to specific workspace

### Repository Discovery
- The connection syncs all repositories for the configured user by default
- Use `teams` to limit syncing to specific workspaces
- Use `exclude` to prevent specific repositories from being synced (takes precedence over `teams`)

### Rate Limiting Behavior
- Sourcegraph respects Bitbucket Cloud's rate limits with exponential backoff
- Requests are retried for up to 5 minutes before being dropped
- Default internal rate limit: 7200 requests per hour

## Security Considerations

### Credential Management
- App passwords provide repository-level access control
- Workspace access tokens offer more granular permissions
- Store credentials securely and rotate them regularly
- Use separate service accounts for production deployments

### Repository Access
- Public repositories are accessible without authentication
- Private repositories require proper credentials
- Authorization enforcement requires matching authentication provider configuration

### SSH vs HTTPS
- HTTPS is the default and recommended clone method
- SSH cloning requires additional key management setup
- Consider firewall rules for SSH access (port 22)

## Common Examples

### Basic Username/App Password Setup
```json
{
  "url": "https://bitbucket.org",
  "username": "service-account",
  "appPassword": "app-password-value",
  "teams": ["my-workspace"],
  "repositoryPathPattern": "{host}/{nameWithOwner}"
}
```

### Workspace Access Token Configuration
```json
{
  "url": "https://bitbucket.org",
  "accessToken": "workspace-token-value",
  "teams": ["my-workspace"],
  "exclude": [
    {"name": "my-workspace/legacy-repo"},
    {"pattern": ".*-archive$"}
  ]
}
```

### SSH Cloning Setup
```json
{
  "url": "https://bitbucket.org",
  "username": "service-account",
  "appPassword": "app-password-value",
  "gitURLType": "ssh",
  "teams": ["my-workspace"]
}
```

### Repository Permissions Enforcement
```json
{
  "url": "https://bitbucket.org",
  "username": "service-account",
  "appPassword": "app-password-value",
  "authorization": {},
  "teams": ["my-workspace"]
}
```

## Best Practices

### Setup and Configuration
- Create dedicated service accounts for Sourcegraph integration
- Use workspace access tokens when working with multiple workspaces
- Configure `repositoryPathPattern` to avoid naming conflicts
- Test connections with minimal repository sets before full deployment

### Security
- Regularly audit and rotate authentication credentials
- Use repository permissions when dealing with sensitive code
- Monitor rate limit usage and adjust request patterns if needed
- Implement proper network security for SSH connections

### Performance
- Use exclude patterns to filter out unnecessary repositories
- Configure appropriate rate limits based on your usage patterns
- Monitor repository sync times and optimize large workspace configurations
- Consider workspace-specific tokens for better performance isolation

### Maintenance
- Keep webhook configurations up to date
- Monitor sync errors and connection health
- Regularly review team and repository configurations
- Plan for authentication provider changes when enforcing permissions

## Webhooks

Using the `webhooks` property on the external service has been deprecated.

Please consult [this page](/admin/config/webhooks/incoming) in order to configure webhooks.
