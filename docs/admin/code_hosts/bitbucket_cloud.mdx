Site admins can sync Git repositories hosted on [Bitbucket Cloud](https://bitbucket.org) with Sourcegraph so that users can search and navigate the repositories.

To connect Bitbucket Cloud to Sourcegraph:

1. Go to **Site admin > Manage code hosts > Add repositories**.
2. Select **Bitbucket.org**.
3. Configure the connection to Bitbucket Cloud using the action buttons above the text field. Additional fields can be added using <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl+Space</kbd> for auto-completion. See the [configuration documentation below](#configuration).
4. Press **Add repositories**.

## Repository syncing

Currently, all repositories belonging to the user configured will be synced.

In addition, there is one more field for configuring which repositories are mirrored:

- [`teams`](/admin/code_hosts/bitbucket_cloud#configuration)
  A list of teams (workspaces) that the configured user has access to whose repositories should be synced.
- [`exclude`](/admin/code_hosts/bitbucket_cloud#configuration)
  A list of repositories to exclude, which takes precedence over the `teams` field.

## Configuration options

Bitbucket Cloud code host connections can be configured with either a username and app password combination, or with workspace access tokens.

### Username and app password

1. Visit your [Bitbucket account settings page](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings).
2. Navigate to **App passwords**.
3. Select **Create app password**.
4. Give your app password a label.
5. Select the `Projects: Read` permission. `Repositories: Read` should automatically be selected.
6. Press **Create**.

Use the newly created app password and your username to configure the Bitbucket Cloud connection:

```json
{
  "url": "https://bitbucket.org",
  "username": "USERNAME",
  "appPassword": "<PASSWORD>",
  // ... other settings
}
```

### Workspace access token

1. Visit the Bitbucket Cloud workspace settings page of the workspace you want to create an access token for.
2. Navigate to **Security > Access tokens**.
3. Press **Create workspace access token**.
4. Give your access token a name.
5. Select the `Projects: Read` permission. `Repositories: Read` should automatically be selected.
6. Press **Create**.

Use the newly created access token to configure the Bitbucket Cloud connection:

```json
{
  "url": "https://bitbucket.org",
  "accessToken": "ACCESS_TOKEN",
  // ... other settings
}
```

### HTTPS cloning

Sourcegraph clones repositories from your Bitbucket Cloud via HTTP(S), using the [`username`](/admin/code_hosts/bitbucket_cloud#configuration) and [`appPassword`](/admin/code_hosts/bitbucket_cloud#configuration) required fields you provide in the configuration.

## Rate limits

Read about how Bitbucket Cloud applies rate limits [here](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/api-request-limits/).

When Sourcegraph encounters rate limits on Bitbucket Cloud, it will retry the request with exponential back-off, until 5 minutes have passed. If the connection is still being rate limited after 5 minutes, the request will be dropped.

### Internal rate limits

See [Internal rate limits](/admin/code_hosts/rate_limits#internal-rate-limits)

## User authentication

To configure Bitbucket Cloud as an authentication provider (which will enable sign-in via Bitbucket Cloud), see the
[authentication documentation](/admin/auth/#bitbucket-cloud).

## Repository permissions

Prerequisite: [Add Bitbucket Cloud as an authentication provider](#user-authentication).

Then, add or edit a Bitbucket Cloud connection as described above and include the `authorization` field:

```json
{
  // The URL used to set up the Bitbucket Cloud authentication provider must match this URL.
  "url": "https://bitbucket.com",
  "username": "horsten",
  "appPassword": "$APP_PASSWORD",
  // ...
  "authorization": {}
}
```

> NOTE: It can take some time to complete full cycle of repository permissions sync if you have a large number of users or repositories. [See sync duration time](/admin/permissions/syncing#sync-duration) for more information.

## Configuration

Bitbucket Cloud connections support the following configuration options, which are specified in the JSON editor in the site admin "Manage code hosts" area.

## Configuration Notes

Bitbucket Cloud connections provide streamlined configuration for cloud-hosted repositories:

- **Authentication Options**: Support for both username/app password and workspace access tokens
- **Repository Selection**: Uses `teams` for workspace-based syncing and `exclude` for filtering unwanted repositories
- **Path Patterns**: The `repositoryPathPattern` field uses `{host}` and `{nameWithOwner}` variables for repository naming
- **Workspace Access**: Workspace access tokens provide more granular control than user-based app passwords

### Authentication Methods

Bitbucket Cloud supports two primary authentication approaches:
- **Username/App Password**: User-scoped access with app passwords created in personal settings
- **Workspace Access Token**: Workspace-scoped access tokens with fine-grained permissions
- **Projects/Repositories Permissions**: Both methods require `Projects: Read` and `Repositories: Read` permissions

### Rate Limiting Configuration

Bitbucket Cloud connections include rate limiting for API management:
- Default: 7,200 requests per hour with rate limiting enabled
- Bitbucket Cloud enforces [API request limits](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/api-request-limits/) based on plan type
- Sourcegraph implements exponential backoff for rate limit handling

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Security

**App Passwords**: Provide user-level access with specific permissions:
- Create app passwords with minimal required permissions (`Projects: Read`, `Repositories: Read`)
- Use dedicated service accounts rather than personal accounts when possible
- App passwords inherit the user's repository access permissions
- Regularly audit and rotate app passwords

**Workspace Access Tokens**: Provide workspace-level access control:
- More secure than user-based app passwords for organizational use
- Scoped to specific workspaces, limiting access surface
- Support fine-grained permissions for better security posture
- Recommended for production deployments

### Repository Permissions

Bitbucket Cloud permission syncing considerations:
- Permission syncing requires Bitbucket Cloud as an authentication provider
- User access is determined by their Bitbucket Cloud account permissions
- Workspace access tokens provide read-only access to repositories
- OAuth flow ensures proper user authentication and authorization

### HTTPS Security

Bitbucket Cloud connections use HTTPS by default:
- All API communication is encrypted using TLS
- Git operations use HTTPS with authentication credentials
- SSH access is supported but requires additional key configuration
- No custom certificate configuration needed for cloud service

## Common Examples

### Basic Team Sync with App Password
```json
{
  "url": "https://bitbucket.org",
  "username": "sourcegraph-bot",
  "appPassword": "ATBBxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "teams": [
    "engineering-team",
    "platform-team"
  ]
}
```

### Workspace Access Token Configuration
```json
{
  "url": "https://bitbucket.org",
  "accessToken": "BBAR-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "teams": ["my-workspace"],
  "exclude": [
    {"name": "my-workspace/legacy-project"},
    {"pattern": "^.*-archive$"}
  ]
}
```

### SSH Access with Custom Path Pattern
```json
{
  "url": "https://bitbucket.org",
  "username": "deployment-user",
  "appPassword": "ATBBxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "teams": ["mobile-apps"],
  "gitURLType": "ssh",
  "repositoryPathPattern": "bitbucket/{nameWithOwner}"
}
```

### Repository Permissions with OAuth
```json
{
  "url": "https://bitbucket.org",
  "accessToken": "BBAR-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "teams": ["enterprise-workspace"],
  "authorization": {},
  "exclude": [
    {"name": "enterprise-workspace/internal-docs"}
  ]
}
```

### High-volume Configuration with Rate Limiting
```json
{
  "url": "https://bitbucket.org",
  "accessToken": "BBAR-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx", 
  "teams": ["large-organization"],
  "rateLimit": {
    "enabled": true,
    "requestsPerHour": 5000
  },
  "webhookSecret": "your-webhook-secret-here"
}
```

## Best Practices

### Authentication Management

1. **Use workspace access tokens** for production deployments instead of personal app passwords
2. **Create dedicated service accounts** when using username/app password authentication
3. **Apply least-privilege principles** by granting only necessary permissions
4. **Regularly audit token usage** and rotate credentials periodically

### Repository Organization

1. **Organize by workspaces** using the `teams` field to sync relevant repositories
2. **Use exclusion patterns** to filter out archived, experimental, or sensitive repositories
3. **Implement consistent naming** with `repositoryPathPattern` for better organization
4. **Monitor workspace changes** as team membership affects repository access

### Performance Optimization

1. **Configure appropriate rate limits** to stay within Bitbucket Cloud's API limits
2. **Use workspace access tokens** for better rate limit handling
3. **Monitor API usage** to avoid hitting plan-based limits
4. **Optimize team selections** to sync only necessary repositories

### Security Management

1. **Enable repository permissions** by configuring Bitbucket Cloud as an auth provider
2. **Use workspace access tokens** for better security isolation
3. **Implement webhook security** with strong shared secrets
4. **Regularly review team membership** to ensure appropriate repository access

### Maintenance

1. **Monitor connection health** through the site admin interface
2. **Review team configurations** as organizational structure changes
3. **Update exclusion patterns** when repository naming conventions change
4. **Test authentication changes** in staging environments before production deployment

## Webhooks

Using the `webhooks` property on the external service has been deprecated.
