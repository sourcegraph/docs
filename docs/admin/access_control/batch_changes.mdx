# Access control for Batch Changes

Granular controls for who can access [Batch Changes](/batch-changes/) can be configured by site admins by tuning the roles assigned to users and the permissions granted to those roles. This page describes the permission types available for Batch Changes, and whether they are granted by default to the **User** [system role](/admin/access_control#system-roles). All permissions are granted to the **Site Administrator** system role by default.
