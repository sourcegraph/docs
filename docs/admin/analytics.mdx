## Data Visualizations

These pages aim to help administrators answer any questions they might have about how features are being used within their Sourcegraph instance. You can view feature-based stats for Search, Batch Changes, Code Insights, and Cody. There are also tabs to study analytics for Search, Completions, and Chats, as well as a general Users page.

Each page can visualize the past week, month, or three months of data.

These graphs pull directly from the event log table within their Sourcegraph instance. Due to these new features, the storage on disk of these tables should not increase. Further, no data beyond published ping data is sent back to Sourcegraph.

## Value Calculators

Each page also includes a total time saved value, which can be used to measure the value Sourcegraph is bringing to your organization. This metric is derived from the configurable calculators below the total time saved value. Each calculator multiplies event log data (e.g., the number of precise code intel events, such as a go-to-definition) by a configurable number of minutes saved per event to arrive at a time saved by the feature.

This is designed to be configurable because we want to:

-   Help admins understand the value that is being seen by their organization today
-   Be customizable so admins can explore what changes will best increase developer time saved

These calculators are on the individual Search, Completions, and Chats analytics pages. If you have questions about how this works or about how to convey this value to your org's stakeholders, please do not hesitate to contact your customer engineer.

## FAQs

### Who has access to see these improved analytics? Where can I find it?

You must be a site admin for your Sourcegraph instance to see the Analytics. You can find these in the **Site Admin** section, under the **Instance Overview** section of the left nav bar.

### Do these improved analytics require sending data to Sourcegraph?

No! The processing happens entirely within your instance, so no data is sent in or out of your instance. Further, these improved analytics leverage data already being captured within your instance's event log table, so there is no additional storage or processing required for this change. Customers should notice no perceivable difference in their infrastructure.

### How often is the data updated?

The data is updated approximately every 24 hours.
