# Outgoing webhooks

<Callout type="note"> This feature is supported on Sourcegraph versions 5.0 or more.</Callout>

Outgoing webhooks can be configured on a Sourcegraph instance in order to send Sourcegraph events to external tools and services. This allows for deeper integrations between Sourcegraph and other applications.

Currently, webhooks are only implemented for events related to [Batch Changes](/batch-changes/). They also cannot yet be scoped to specific entities, meaning that they will be triggered for all events of the specified type across Sourcegraph. Expanded support for more event types and scoped events is planned for the future. Please [let us know](mailto:feedback@sourcegraph.com) what types of events you would like to see implemented next, or if you have any other feedback!

> WARNING: Outgoing webhooks have the potential to send sensitive information about your repositories and code to other untrusted services. When configuring outgoing webhooks, be sure to only send events to trusted service URLs and to use the shared secret to verify any requests received.

## Adding an outgoing webhook

1. Navigate to **Site Admin > Configuration > Ougoing webhooks**
   ![Outgoing webhooks page](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/docs/images/administration/config/webhooks/outgoing-webhooks-page.png)
1. Click **+ Create webhook**
   ![Adding an outgoing webhook](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/docs/images/administration/config/webhooks/adding-outgoing-webhook.png)
1. Fill out the form:
   1. **URL**: URL endpoint of the external service that Sourcegraph should send webhook events to.
   1. **Secret**: An arbitrary secret to share between Sourcegraph and the external service. A default value is provided, but you are free to change it.
   1. **Event types**: The types of [events](#supported-event-types) that will trigger a webhook event. Currently, only events related to Batch Changes are supported.
1. Click **Create**

The outgoing webhook will now be created and active. To view or edit its details, or to see the log of event requests that have been sent for it, click the **Edit** button on the outgoing webhook's row.

#### Example payload

The batch change webhook event payload mirrors the [GraphQL API](/api/graphql/) `BatchChange` type and contains the following fields:

```json
{
  // The unique ID for the batch change.
  "id": "QmF0Y2hDaGFuZ2U6MTcz",

  "namespace_id": "VXNlcjox",
  // The name of the batch change.
  "name": "hello-world",
  // The description of the batch change (as Markdown).
  "description": "Add Hello World to READMEs",

  "state": "OPEN",
  // The ID of the user who created this batch change.
  "creator_user_id": "VXNlcjox",
  // The ID of the user who last applied a spec to this batch change.
  "last_applier_user_id": "VXNlcjox",
  // The URL path on Sourcegraph for this batch change.
  "url": "/users/my-username/batch-changes/hello-world",
  // The date and time when the batch change was created.
  "created_at": "2023-03-19T05:41:24Z",

  "batch_change_ids": [
    "QmF0Y2hDaGFuZ2U6MTcz"
