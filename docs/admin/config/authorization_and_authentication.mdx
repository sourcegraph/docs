# Authentication and authorization

Sourcegraph has two authentication concepts:

1. The system through which your users log in (SAML IdP, OAuth with a code host, username/password, OpenID Connect, Authentication Proxy)
2. The system which controls user permissions (Code host, explicit permissions API in Sourcegraph)

We suggest configuring both when using Sourcegraph Enterprise. If you do not configure permissions, all users will be able to see all of the code in the instance.

## Authentication

Sourcegraph supports username/password auth by default and SAML, OAuth, HTTP Proxy auth, and OpenID Connect if configured. Changing a username in Sourcegraph will allow the user to escalate permissions, so if you are syncing permissions, you will need to add the following to your site config at `https://sourcegraph.yourdomain.com/siteadmin/configuration` ([Learn more about viewing and editing your site configuration.](/admin/config/site_config#view-and-edit-site-configuration))

```json
{
  "auth.enableUsernameChanges": false
}
```

For users using any of the other authentication mechanisms, removing `builtin` as an authentication mechanism is best practice.

> NOTE: If Sourcegraph is running on a free license all users will be created as site admins. Learn more about license settings on our [pricing page](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing).

## Repository permissions in Sourcegraph

See [repository permissions documentation](/admin/permissions/).

## Username normalization

Sourcegraph does not support email-style usernames. In contexts in which you are providing the username to Sourcegraph, it will be normalized, which can impact username matching where that is relevant. See [full documentation for username normalization](/admin/auth/#username-normalization).

## Instructions for individual authentication/authorization pathways

We recommend that you start at the instructions for your code host, if listed, for a complete explanation of the authentication/authorization options available to you when using that code host.

### Built-in username/password authentication

Built-in username/password authentication is Sourcegraph’s default authentication option. To enable it, add the following to your site config:

```json
{
  // Other config settings go here
  "auth.providers": [
    {
      "type": "builtin",
      "allowSignup": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Set `allowSignup` to `false` if you want to create user accounts instead of allowing the user to create their own.

Learn more about [built-in password authentication](/admin/auth/#builtin-password-authentication).

### GitHub Enterprise or GitHub Cloud authentication and authorization

We support both authentication and permissions syncing (through OAuth) for GitHub. If you use GitHub as your code host, we do not officially support using another authentication mechanism (SAML, etc.). Instead, you’ll need to follow this flow:

1. Use SAML (or another auth mechanism) to log in to GitHub
2. Use GitHub OAuth to log in to Sourcegraph

In this way, access to Sourcegraph will still be managed by your identity provider, using the code host as a middle step.

Follow these steps to [configure authentication with GitHub via OAuth](/admin/auth/#github).

Once authentication with GitHub via OAuth is configured, follow [these steps to configure access permissions](/admin/code_hosts/github#repository-permissions). Users will log into Sourcegraph using Github OAuth, and permissions will be synced in the background.

### GitLab Enterprise or GitLab Cloud authentication and authorization

We support both authentication and permissions syncing (through OAuth) for GitLab. If you use GitLab as your code host, you have two available authentication flows:

#### Option 1

1. Use SAML (or another auth mechanism) to log in to GitLab
2. Use GitLab OAuth to log in to Sourcegraph

In this way, access to Sourcegraph will still be managed by your identity provider, using the code host as a middle step. This option is the simplest to configure. To do so, [set up GitLab as an authentication option](/admin/auth/#gitlab), and then [enable permissions syncing](/admin/code_hosts/gitlab#oauth-application).

#### Option 2

Alternatively, you can configure SAML authentication in Sourcegraph, and use GitLab permissions syncing in the background to control access permissions. To implement this method, you will need to make sure that GitLab is able to return a value in `identities.provider` for the `GET /users` endpoint ([GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/users.html#for-admins)) that your identity provider is able to pass as the `nameID` in the SAML response. If that isn’t possible, you will need to use the first option.

To configure SAML auth with GitLab permissions, you will need to first [configure permissions from GitLab](/admin/code_hosts/gitlab#administrator-sudo-level-access-token). Then, [configure SAML authentication](/admin/auth/saml/). The `nameID` passed by the identity provider will need to match the value of `identities.provider`.

For example, if the GitLab API returns:

```json
{
  "identities": [{ "provider": "saml", "extern_uid": "email@domain.com" }]
}
```

Then you will need to configure permission in Sourcegraph as:

```json
{
  "url": "https://gitlab.com",
  "token": "$PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
  "authorization": {
    "identityProvider": {
      "type": "external",
      "authProviderID": "$AUTH_PROVIDER_ID",
      "authProviderType": "$AUTH_PROVIDER_TYPE",
      "gitlabProvider": "saml"
    }
  }
}
```

And configure the identity provider to pass the email address as the `nameID`.

### Bitbucket Server / Bitbucket Data Center authorization

We support authentication through OAuth for Bitbucket Server / Bitbucket Data Center. See the [Bitbucket Server auth provider docs](/admin/auth/#bitbucket-server).

### Azure DevOps Services

We support authentication through OAuth for [Azure DevOps Services (dev.azure.com)](https://dev.azure.com) and it is also a prerequisite for [permissions syncing](/admin/permissions/).

#### Register a new Entra OAuth application

[Create a new Entra OAuth application](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/CreateApplicationBlade/quickStartType~/null/isMSAApp~/false) and follow the instructions below:

1. In the `Name` field pick a descriptive name for this connection
2. For `Supported account types` select `Accounts in this organizational directory only`
3. For `Redirect URI` pick `Web`(!) for the type and set the URL field to `https://<myinstance.sourcegraph.com>/.auth/azuredevops/callback` if your Sourcegraph instance URL is https://myinstance.sourcegraph.com
4. Click **Register**
5. Now go to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) as at least an **Application Developer**.
6. Go to **App registrations** and select the one you just created.
7. Go to **Manage > Certificates & secrets** and generate a new client secret. Keep the secret value.
8. Go to **Manage > API Permissions** and click **+ Add a permission**. Select Azure DevOps, then `vso.code`, `vso.identity`, and `vso.project`.  Confirm with **Add permissions**.
9. Go back to **Overview** from the sidebar. Now find the **Endpoints** button at the top center of the page, and take note of the value for **Authority URL (Accounts in this organizational directory only)** (which will look something like _https://login.microsoftonline.com/00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000_)
10. The final value we need to get is the **Application (client) ID** from the **Overview** page. Take note of this UUID as well.

#### Configuring Sourcegraph auth.providers

With all the values acquired above, you can now add the following to the `auth.providers` key in the site config:

```json
{
  "auth.providers": [
    // Other auth providers may also be here.
    {
      "type": "azureDevOps", // Casing is important!
      "displayName": "Azure DevOps",
      "url": "<Authority URL (Accounts in this organizational directory only)>",
      "clientID": "<Application (client) ID>",
      "clientSecret": "<Client secret>"
    }
  ]
}
```

Optionally, you may want to restrict the sign up to only users who belong to a specific list of organizations. To do this add the following to the `auth.providers` configuration above:

```json
{
  "allowOrgs": ["your-org-1", "your-org-2"]
}
```

Finally, if you want to prevent new users from signing up to your Sourcegraph instance, set the following (default to `true`) in the `auth.providers` configuration above:

```json
{
  "allowSignup": false
}
```

The final and complete `auth.providers` configuration may look like this:

```json
{
  "auth.providers": [
    // Other auth providers may also be here.
    {
      "type": "azureDevOps",
      "displayName": "Azure DevOps",
      "url": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000",
      "clientID": "your-client-id-here",
      "clientSecret": "a-strong-client-secret-here",
      "allowOrgs": ["your-org-1", "your-org-2"],
      "allowSignup": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explicit Permissions API authorization

With any authentication mechanism, you can use our GraphQL API to set permissions for all repositories. If you choose to do this, this is the _only_ mechanism that can be used for permissions—all others will be ignored. Follow the instructions for the [mutations needed within the GraphQL API](/admin/permissions/api) to configure access.

### OpenID Connect authentication

Use OpenID Connect authentication if accessing using OpenID Connect, such as when logging in through a Google Workspace, or if other authentication methods aren’t an option. See [how to set up OpenID Connect authentication](/admin/auth/#openid-connect).

### HTTP authentication proxy authentication

HTTP authentication proxy authentication is not generally recommended unless it's a common authentication process within your organization. See [how to configure HTTP authentication proxies](/admin/auth/#http-authentication-proxies).
