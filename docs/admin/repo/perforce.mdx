# Using Perforce depots with Sourcegraph

Sourcegraph supports [Perforce Helix](https://www.perforce.com/solutions/version-control) depots using [p4-fusion](https://github.com/salesforce/p4-fusion). This creates an equivalent Git repository from a Perforce depot, which can then be indexed by Sourcegraph.

## Add a Perforce code host connection

Perforce depots can be added to a Sourcegraph instance by adding the appropriate [code host connection](/admin/code-hosts/).

To enable Perforce code host connections, a site admin must:

1. Go to **Site admin > Manage code hosts > Add code host**

1. Scroll down the list of supported code hosts and select **Perforce**.

1. Configure which depots are mirrored/synchronized as Git repositories to Sourcegraph:

    - [`depots`](/admin/repo/perforce#depots)

        A list of depot paths that can be either a depot root or an arbitrary subdirectory. **Note**: Only `"local"` type depots are supported.

    - [`p4.user`](/admin/repo/perforce#p4-user)

        The user to be authenticated for `p4` CLI, and should be capable of performing:

        - `p4 login`
        - `p4 trust`
        - and any p4 commands involved with `git p4 clone` and `git p4 sync` for listed `depots`.

        If repository permissions are mirrored, the user needs additional ability (aka. "super" access level) to perform the commands:

        - `p4 protects`
        - `p4 groups`
        - `p4 group`
        - `p4 users`

    - [`p4.passwd`](/admin/repo/perforce#p4-passwd)

        The ticket to be used for authenticating the `p4.user`. It is recommended to create tickets of users in a group that never expire. Use the command `p4 -u <p4.user> login -p -a` to obtain a ticket value.

    - See the [configuration documentation below](#configuration) for other fields you can configure.

1. Configure `fusionClient`:

    ```json
    {
    	"fusionClient": {
    		"enabled": true,
    		"lookAhead": 2000
    	}
    }
    ```

    > NOTE: While the `fusionClient` configuration is optional, without it the code host connection uses `git p4`, which has performance issues so we strongly recommend `p4-fusion`.

1. Click **Add repositories**.

Sourcegraph will now talk to the Perforce host and sync the configured `depots` to the Sourcegraph instance.

It's worthwhile to note some limitations of this process:

-   When syncing depots [p4-fusion](https://github.com/salesforce/p4-fusion) is used to convert Perforce depots into git repositories so that Sourcegraph can index them.
-   Rename of a Perforce depot, including changing the depot on the Perforce server or the `repositoryPathPattern` config option, will cause a re-import of the depot.
-   Unless [permissions syncing](#repository-permissions) is enabled, Sourcegraph is not aware of the depot permissions, so it can't enforce access restrictions.

## Perforce labels

Perforce labels are converted to Git tags, but only under the following conditions:

-   The depot is fully contained within one of the label's views. (i.e. the depot is contained at `//path/to/depot/...` and the label's view is `//path/to/depot/...`).
-   The label has a Revision field that matches a single revision. (i.e. `@4521`)

Perforce label names are also more flexible than git tag names, so incompatible characters are replaced with underscores. (i.e. `v1:2:3` will become `v1_2_3`)

This behaviour can be disabled by setting `noConvertLabels` to `true` in the fusion client configuration.

## Repository permissions (Beta)

To enforce file-level permissions for Perforce depots using the [Perforce protects file](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/p4_protect.html), include the `authorization` field in the configuration of the Perforce code host connection you created [above](#add-a-perforce-code-host):

```json
{
	"authorization": {}
}
```

Adding the `authorization` field to the code host connection configuration will enable partial parsing of the protects file. [Learn more about the partial support of protects file parsing](#known-issues-and-limitations).

### Syncing subdirectories to match permission boundaries

By default Sourcegraph only supports repository-level permissions and does not match the granularity of the [Perforce protects file](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/p4_protect.html).

If you don't [activate file-level permissions](#file-level-permissions) you should sync subdirectories of a depot using the `depots` configuration that best describes the most concrete path of your permissions boundary.

For example, if your Perforce depot `//depot/Talkhouse` has different permissions for `//depot/Talkhouse/main-dev` and subdirectories `//depot/Talkhouse/rel1.0/front`, `//depot/Talkhouse/rel1.0/back` we recommend setting the following `depots`:

```json
{
	"depots": [
		"//depot/Talkhouse/main-dev/",
		"//depot/Talkhouse/rel1.0/front/",
		"//depot/Talkhouse/rel1.0/back/"
	]
}
```

By configuring each subdirectory that has unique permissions, Sourcegraph is able to recognize and enforce permissions for the sub-directories. You can **NOT** define these permissions as:

```json
{
	"depots": [
		"//depot/Talkhouse/main-dev/",
		"//depot/Talkhouse/rel1.0/",
		"//depot/Talkhouse/rel1.0/back/"
	]
}
```

Since that would override the permissions for the `//depot/Talkhouse/rel1.0/back` depot.

#### Wildcards

[File-level permissions](#file-level-permissions) can handle wildcards in the protects file.
If file-level permissions is not enabled, Sourcegraph provides limited support for `*` and `...` paths, so the workaround of [adding sub-folders as separate repositories](#syncing-subdirectories-to-match-permission-boundaries) for the paths that employ wildcards needs to be followed.

### File-level permissions

File-level permissions eliminate the need for [syncing subdirectories to match permission boundaries](#syncing-subdirectories-to-match-permission-boundaries).

To enable file-level permissions:

1. Add the following entry to your site configuration file:

    ```json
    {
    	"experimentalFeatures": {
    		"subRepoPermissions": {"enabled": true}
    	}
    }
    ```

2. Enable the feature in the code host configuration by adding `subRepoPermissions` to the `authorization` object:

    ```json
    {
    	"authorization": {
    		"subRepoPermissions": true
    	}
    }
    ```

3. Save the configuration.

Permissions will be synced in the background based on your [Perforce protects file](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/p4_protect.html).

#### Handling IP-based rules

Perforce's `protects` table allows administrators to define fine-grained access controls based on user identities and host IP addresses. By default, Sourcegraph applies all rules from the `protects` table without considering host-specific restrictions, effectively treating all host rules as the wildcard `*`. This behavior can lead to users having unintended access to repositories or files that should be restricted based on their IP addresses.

If your Perforce environment relies heavily on host-based permissions, it's crucial to configure Sourcegraph appropriately to respect these restrictions. This documentation provides detailed instructions on how to enforce or ignore host rules in Sourcegraph when integrating with Perforce.

##### Default Behavior

By default, Sourcegraph:

-   **Applies all rules** in the Perforce `protects` table.
-   **Ignores host-specific restrictions**, treating all host fields as `*`.

**Implication**: Users may gain access to resources that should be restricted based on their IP addresses.

##### Configuration Options

To ensure Sourcegraph handles host rules according to your requirements, you have two additional options:

1. **Enforce Host Rules**: Configure Sourcegraph to respect and enforce IP-based restrictions defined in the `protects` table.
2. **Ignore Host-Specific Rules**: Configure Sourcegraph to disregard any rules with a host value other than `*`.

##### Enforcing host rules

If you want Sourcegraph to enforce host-specific permissions, you need to enable IP restriction enforcement in your [site configuration](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/config/site-config):

```json
{
	"experimentalFeatures": {
		"subRepoPermissions": {
			"enabled": true,
			"enforceIPRestrictions": true
		}
	}
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
	When `enforceIPRestrictions` is set to `true`, Sourcegraph will use the
	user's IP address to apply Perforce permissions at the user level. It uses
	the final `X-Forwarded-For` header in the request to identify the user's IP.
	Note that this header can be easily spoofed, so ensure your load balancer or
	proxy handles `X-Forwarded-For` headers securely.
</Callout>

##### Ignore rules with host

To ignore rules that have a host value other than `*`, set `ignoreRulesWithHost` to `true` in your **code host configuration**:

```json
{
	"authorization": {
		"subRepoPermissions": true,
		"ignoreRulesWithHost": true
	}
}
```

With this setting, Sourcegraph will ignore any rules with a host other than `*`, treating them as if they do not exist.

### Notes about permissions

-   Sourcegraph users are mapped to Perforce users based on their verified email addresses.
-   As long as a user has been granted at least `Read` permissions in Perforce they will be able to view content in Sourcegraph.
-   As a special case, commits in which a user does not have permissions to read any files are hidden. If a user can read a subset of files in a commit, only those files are shown.
-   [file-level permissions must be disabled for Batch Changes to work](#known-issues-and-limitations).
-   Setting `authz.enforceForSiteAdmins` to `true` in the site configuration will enforce permissions for admin users. They may not be able to see repositories and their contents if their Sourcegraph user account email does not match with their email on the Perforce server.

## Known issues and limitations

We are actively working to significantly improve Sourcegraph's Perforce support. Please [contact us](https://help.sourcegraph.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to help us prioritize any specific improvements you'd like to see.

-   Sourcegraph was initially built for Git repositories only, so it stores Perforce depots as Git repositories when syncing. Perforce concepts and languages are expressed in the UI, but under the hood, Git tools are used.
-   Batch Changes does not support [file-level permissions](#file-level-permissions) (also known as sub-repo permissions)
-   Batch Changes does not handle the shelved changelist other than to query the Perforce server for its status.
-   Permalinks with Changelist Id do not work yet

## Configure experimental features

As of Sourcegraph 5.1, there are the following experimental features for Perforce depots. These are merely for providing feedback and have [limited support](/admin/beta-and-experimental-features#experimental-features).

### Changelist ID in URLs

Note: When enabling changelist IDs in URLs for the first time, Perforce depots can be unavailable for a few minutes on the Sourcegraph instance, due to the initial mapping of changelist IDs to generated commit ID happening in the background. If you have a large number of Perforce depots, we recommend proceeding with the following steps in a maintenance window in which you don't expect large amounts of traffic on your Sourcegraph instance.

Add `"perforceChangelistMapping": "enabled",` to `experimentalFeatures` in the [site configuration](/admin/config/site-config):

```json
{
	"experimentalFeatures": {
		"perforceChangelistMapping": "enabled"
	}
}
```

When enabled, URLs for Perforce code hosts will use the Changelist (CL) ID instead of commit SHAs. Areas that benefit from this at the moment are:

-   Viewing a specific CL
-   Viewing the files of a depot at a specific CL
-   Viewing a specific file added / removed / modified in a specific CL
-   Viewing the list of CLs

### Searching within a specific changelist

As of Sourcegraph 5.5, you can search within a specific changelist by referring the the changelist as a reference path like `changelist/123` where 123 is the changelist id. For example, given a repo path of `Talkhouse/main` and a changelist id of `123`, you can search within that changelist by using the following query:

```
repo:^Talkhouse/main$@changelist/123 text to find
```

or

```
repo:^Talkhouse/main$ rev:changelist/123 text to find
```

#### Limitations

-   After a depot is cloned or fetched, Sourcegraph computes and stores mappings of CL IDs to commit SHAs. This mapping can take several minutes for large clones/fetches. When a background mapping job is running, the depot won't be serviceable as URLs referring to CL IDs may not resolve and users may see an error while interacting with the depot.
-   This experimental configuration can not be selectively enabled for a specific perforce depot.

#### Mechanism

To support CLs natively in the URLs, Sourcegraph performs background computation after syncing the contents of a depot. That's done by parsing each generated commit to retrieve the corresponding CL ID and store it in the `repo_commits_changelists` table. This is currently performed on only one depot at a time and we are working to support this for multiple depots in parallel in an upcoming release.

Additionally, while removing a depot from a code host config will mark it as "deleted", the mapped information will **not** be deleted to prevent forced re-computation after an accidental removal of depot from a code host config. Similarly recloning a depot will **not** trigger a computation of all the CLs from the beginning of the depot's source control history. If site admins are recloning or deleting and re-adding a depot to Sourcegraph as a result of history rewrite of a depot in Perforce, they should get in [touch with us](mailto:support@sourcegraph.com) for next steps.

### Batch Changes support for Perforce depots

Add `"batchChanges.enablePerforce": true` to `experimentalFeatures` in the [site configuration](/admin/config/site-config):

```json
{
	"experimentalFeatures": {
		"batchChanges.enablePerforce": true
	}
}
```

Batch Changes does not support repos that use sub-repo permissions, so in order to use batch changes with Perforce depots, the code host cannot use [file-level permissions](#file-level-permissions).

When a Batch Change is published, it is sent as a shelved changelist to the server configured in the code host. The Changelist Id is displayed in the UI for the user to use for managing the shelved changelist.
