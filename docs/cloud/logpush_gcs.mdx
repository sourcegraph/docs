# LogPush for Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

## Overview

Our services will periodically push audit logs to customer-managed GCS bucket. Authentication and authorization are securely handled by GCP IAM service.

## Steps

To enable this feature, please contact your assigned Customer Engineer (CE) or support team to obtain the specific instruction. Below is a high level overview of the steps.

- Sourcegraph provides below information to customer:
  - email of a Sourcegraph-owned GCP Service Account (GSA)
  - a unique file to prove bucket ownership
- Customer to perform the following:
  - creates a GCS bucket
  - grants the Sourcegraph-owned GSA sufficient IAM roles to access the bucket
  - uploads the ownership file to prove bucket ownership
- Customer to inform Sourcegraph of the bucket name

Once completed, Sourcegraph will complete the LogPush configuration and start sending logs to the customer-managed GCS bucket.
