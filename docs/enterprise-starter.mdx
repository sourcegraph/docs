# Enterprise Starter

<p className="subtitle">Learn about the Enterprise Starter plan tailored for teams and individuals.</p>

<Callout type="info">Enterprise Starter is available for Sourcegraph versions 6.0+ and supports VS Code, JetBrains, Cody Web.</Callout>

The Enterprise Starter plan offers a multi-tenant Sourcegraph instance designed for individuals and teams offering the core features of a traditional Sourcegraph instance but with a simplified management experience. This plan provides a fully managed version of Sourcegraph (AI + code search + omnibox, with privately indexed code) through a self-serve flow.

## Team seats

The Enterprise Starter plan is priced at **$19 per month per seat**. You can add or remove team members at any time. Existing Cody Pro users can also sign up for the Enterprise Starter by paying $19 per seat. However, their Cody Pro subscription will neither be upgraded nor canceled. Instead, they will have two live subscriptions.

## Enterprise Starter team roles

The Enterprise Starter plan includes the following team-level roles:

- **Admin**: Has full access to the workspace, including the ability to manage users, billing, and settings
- **Member**: Can access repositories in the workspace and use the supported features

## Billing

Workspaces on the Enterprise Starter plan are billed monthly based on the number of team seats purchased. In case of overdue or failing payment, there is a grace period during which the workspace admins will receive a daily notification to complete the transaction.

## Downgrading Enterprise Starter

To downgrade your Enterprise Starter, there are two options:

- Delete the workspace â€” this cancels the subscription, and you lose access to the workspace
- Cancel the workspace subscription from the **Billing** settings. This allows you to access the workspace until the end of the current billing period

Once access to your workspace is revoked, all your data and settings are permanently deleted.
