# Cody Ignore

<Callout type="note">This feature is currently in the Experimental stage and only supported with VS Code extension.</Callout>

This guide will walk you through the process of ignoring specific files or folders in your codebase when using Cody. 

## Enabling Unstable Features

To use the ignore context feature, you first need to enable unstable features in Cody. Here's how:

1. Open your settings in Cody Extension
2. Next go to the `settings.json` file
3. Add a new line: `"cody.unstableFeatures": true`.

This will enable experimental features, including the ignore context feature.

## Using the Ignore Context Feature

To ignore specific files or folders from the context taken by Cody, you need to create a `ignore` file in your project. Here's how:

1. Create a new folder in your project root named `.cody`.
2. Inside the `.cody` folder, create a file named `ignore`.
3. In the `ignore` file, specify the files or folders you want to ignore.

The `.codyignore` file works similarly to a `.gitignore` file. If you want to ignore a file named `secret.json`, you would add `secret.json` to your `.codyignore` file. If you're going to ignore a folder called `lib/shared`, you would add `lib/shared/` to your `.codyignore` file.

Once a file or folder is added to the `.codyignore` file, Cody will no longer provide autocomplete suggestions for that file or folder, and it will not appear in your chat results.
