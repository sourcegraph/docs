# Code Graph

<p className="subtitle">Understand what is Code Graph and how Cody use it to gather context.</p>

Code Graph is a key component of Cody's capacity to generate contextual responses based on your codebase. It involves analyzing the structure of the code rather than treating it as plain text. Cody examines how different components of the codebase are interconnected and how they are used.

This method is dependent on the code's structure and inheritance relationships. It can help Cody find context related to your input based on how code elements are linked and utilized.

## Code Graph data

Code graph data refers to the information that describes various semantic elements within your source code, like definitions, references, symbols, and doc comments. This dataset is produced by an indexer and subsequently transferred to a Sourcegraph instance.

The process of generating this data can vary based on factors such as the programming language and build system in use. In some cases, Sourcegraph can automatically create this data through auto-indexing within the platform itself.

Alternately, you may need to set up a periodic CI job, specifically designed to produce and upload this index to your Sourcegraph instance.

>NOTE: As of January 23, 2023, open-source projects have the capability to generate Code Graph data in their CI pipelines and then upload it to Sourcegraph.com, enhancing precision in code navigation.

## Code Graph data uploads

[Code graph indexers](/code_navigation/references/indexers) analyze source code and generate an index file, which is subsequently [uploaded to a Sourcegraph instance](/code_navigation/how-to/index_other_languages#4-upload-lsif-data) using [Sourcegraph CLI](/cli/) for processing. Once processed, this data becomes available for [precise code navigation queries](/code_navigation/explanations/precise_code_navigation).

## Lifecycle of an upload

Uploaded index files are processed asynchronously from a queue. Each upload has an attached `state` that can change as work associated with that data is performed. The following diagram shows the possible transition paths from one `state` of an upload to another.

The typical sequence for a successful upload is: `UPLOADING_INDEX`, `QUEUED_FOR_PROCESSING`, `PROCESSING`, and `COMPLETED`.

In some cases, the processing of an index file may fail due to issues such as malformed input or transient network errors. When this happens, an upload enters the `PROCESSING_ERRORED` state. Such error uploads may undergo multiple retry attempts before moving into a permanent error state.

At any point, an uploaded record may be deleted. This can happen due to various reasons, such as being replaced by a newer upload, due to the age of the upload record, or by explicit deletion initiated by the user. When deleting a record that could be used for code navigation queries, it transitions first into the `DELETING` state. This temporary state allows Sourcegraph to manage the set of Code Graph uploads smoothly.

Changing the state of an upload to or from `COMPLETED` requires updating the [repository commit graph](#repository-commit-graph). This process can be computationally expensive for the worker service or Postgres database.

## Lifecycle of an upload (via UI)

After successfully uploading an index file, the Sourcegraph CLI will provide a URL on the target instance to track the progress of that upload.

You can view the data uploads for a specific repository by navigating to the Code Graph page on the target repository's index page.

Alternatively, website administrators of a Sourcegraph instance can access a global view of Code Graph data uploads across all repositories from the **Site Admin** page.

## Repository commit graph

Sourcegraph maintains a mapping from a commit of a repository to the set of upload records that can resolve a query for that commit. When an upload record transitions to or from the `COMPLETED` state, the set of eligible uploads changes, and this mapping must be recalculated.

Upon a state change in an upload, we flag the repository as needing an update. Subsequently, the worker service updates the commit graph and asynchronously clears the flag for that repository.

When an upload changes state, the repository is flagged as requiring an update status. Then the [`worker` service](/admin/workers#codeintel-commitgraph)
will update the commit graph and unset the flag for that repository asynchronously.

While this flag is set, the repository's commit graph is considered `stale`. This means there may be some upload records in a `COMPLETED` state that aren't yet used to resolve code navigation queries.

The state of a repository's commit graph can be seen in the code graph data page on the target repository's index page.

Once the commit graph has updated (and no subsequent changes to that repository's uploads have occurred), the repository commit graph is no longer considered `stale`.
