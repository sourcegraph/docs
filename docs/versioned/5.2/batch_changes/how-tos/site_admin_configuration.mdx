# Site admin configuration for Batch Changes

#### Setup Batch Changes

1. Using Batch Changes requires a [code host connection](/admin/external_services/) to a supported code host (currently GitHub, Bitbucket Server / Bitbucket Data Center, GitLab, and Bitbucket Cloud).

1. (Optional) [Configure which users have access to Batch Changes](/admin/access_control/batch_changes) <span class="badge badge-beta">Beta</span>. By default, all users can create and view batch changes, but only the batch change's author or a site admin can administer a given batch change.
    * Additionally, you can also [customize org settings](/admin/config/batch_changes#enable-organization-members-to-administer) to allow members of an organization to share administration privileges over batch changes created in that organization.

1. (Optional) [Configure repository permissions](/admin/permissions/), which Batch Changes will respect.

1. [Configure credentials](/batch_changes/how-tos/configuring_credentials).

1. [Setup incoming webhooks](/admin/config/webhooks/incoming) to make sure changesets sync fast. See [Batch Changes effect on codehost rate limits](/batch_changes/references/requirements#batch-changes-effect-on-code-host-rate-limits).

1. Configure any desired optional features, such as:
    * [Rollout windows](/admin/config/batch_changes#rollout-windows), which control the rate at which Batch Changes will publish changesets on code hosts.
    * [Forks](/admin/config/batch_changes#forks), which push branches created by Batch Changes onto forks of the upstream repository instead than the repository itself.
    * [Outgoing webhooks](/admin/config/webhooks/outgoing), which publish events related to batch changes and changesets to enable deeper integrations with your other tools and systems.
    * [Auto-delete branch on merge/close](/admin/config/batch_changes#automatically-delete-branches-on-merge-close), which automatically deletes branches created by Batch Changes when changesets are merged or closed.
    * [Commit signing for GitHub](/admin/config/batch_changes#commit-signing-for-github), which signs commits created by Batch Changes via a GitHub App (Beta).
