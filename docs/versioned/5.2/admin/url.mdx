# Configuring the external URL

It is highly recommended that you do NOT make any of the nodes running Sourcegraph directly accessible to the Internet. Instead, configure an [Internet Gateway](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html) or equivalent to forward traffic to `httpNodePort` or `httpsNodePort` on any of the nodes in your cluster.

When that is done, update your DNS records to point to your gateway's external IP, and change the following line in your [site configuration](/admin/config/site_config):

```json
{
  // ...
  "externalURL": "https://domain.example.com"
  // ...
}
```

> NOTE: `externalURL` was called `appURL` in Sourcegraph 2.13 and earlier.
