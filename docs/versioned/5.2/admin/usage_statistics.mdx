# Usage statistics

> NOTE: With 3.42 we introduced an all new analytics experience for admins. More information can be found [here](/admin/analytics).

Sourcegraph records basic per-user usage statistics. To view analytics, visit the **Site admin > Usage stats** page. (The URL is `https://sourcegraph.example.com/site-admin/usage-statistics`.) This information is available via the GraphQL API to all viewers (not just site admins).

Here you can see charts with counts of unique users by day, week, or months.

From this page, you can also see user-level activity, including counts of pageviews, searches, and code intelligence actions, and last active times. This user-level data is all stored locally on your Sourcegraph instance, and is never sent to Sourcegraph.com. The user-specific values are recorded over all time.
