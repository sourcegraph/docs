# Executor configuration

The following is a list of all of the configuration options for the executor service. The process for configuring your executor instance will vary depending on the executor deployment method selected, but are generally defined as environment variables either in the executor Docker container or directly on the host machine, depending on whether the service is running in Docker or as a native Linux binary.
