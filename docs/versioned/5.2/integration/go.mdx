# Go dependencies integration with Sourcegraph

You can use Sourcegraph with Go modules from any Go module proxy, including open source code from proxy.golang.org or a private proxy such as [Athens](https://github.com/gomods/athens).

This integration makes it possible to search and navigate through the source code of published Go modules (for example, [`gorilla/mux@v1.8.0`](https://sourcegraph.com/go/github.com/gorilla/mux@v1.8.0)).

Feature | Supported?

## Setup

See the "[Go dependencies](/admin/external_service/go)" documentation.

## Repository syncing

Site admins can [add Go packages to Sourcegraph](/admin/external_service/go#repository-syncing).

## Repository permissions

⚠️ Go dependency repositories are visible by all users of the Sourcegraph instance.

## Multiple Go dependencies code hosts

⚠️ It's only possible to create one Ruby dependency code host for each Sourcegraph instance.

See the issue [sourcegraph#32461](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/32461) for more details about this limitation.
