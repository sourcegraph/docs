# Firefox Migration from self-hosted to Add-ons Store

We've recently migrated from hosting the Sourcegraph Firefox extension ourselves to hosting it in the Firefox add-ons store, to improve the update process.

If you previously installed the Firefox extension from our website, the first time you update it you'll need to reinstall the extension from the Firefox store, which can be done in two quick steps:  

First, remove your current Sourcegraph extension by right-clicking the Sourcegraph logo and selecting "Remove Extension" from the dropdown. Second, navigate to the [Sourcegraph extension page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sourcegraph-for-firefox/) on the Firefox add-ons store and install the latest Sourcegraph extension.

Future updates will be distributed through the Firefox store and won't require a re-install.
