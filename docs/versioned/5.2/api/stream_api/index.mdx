# Sourcegraph Stream API

<Callout type="note">The Stream API is still evolving. Although parts of it can be considered stable, we don't guarantee backward compatibility just yet. This means it is possible that fields are added, removed, or renamed. All backward incompatible changes to the event stream format will be documented in the [CHANGELOG](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/CHANGELOG).</Callout>

With the Stream API you can consume search results and related metadata as
a stream of events. The Sourcegraph UI calls the Stream API for all interactive searches.
Compared to our [GraphQL API](/api/graphql/), it offers shorter times to first results and
supports running exhaustive searches returning a large volume of results without
putting pressure on the backend.

| display-limit   | The maximum number of matches the backend returns. Defaults to -1 (no limit). If the backend finds more then display-limit results, it will keep searching and aggregating statistics, but the matches will not be returned anymore. Note that the display-limit is different from the query filter `count:` which causes the search to stop and return once we found `count:` matches. |

See [Example](#example-curl).

## Event stream format

The API responds with a stream of events. Each event consists of exactly two
fields, event and data, one per line. Events are separated by 2 newline
characters, `\n\n`. The value of `event:` is always a string that describes the
type of the event. The value of `data:` is always JSON.

```text
event: <event-type> // event 1
data: <JSON>

event: <event-type> // event 2
data: <JSON>

...

event: done // last event
data: {}
```

> NOTE:
> Our format is a subset of the event stream format for [server-sent
> events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#event_stream_format). However, we do not guarantee compatibility with any third-party clients written for server-sent events.

### Event-types

Events can be of the following types:

| event-type |                                   description                                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| matches    | matches can be of type content, path, commit, diff, symbol and repo              |
| progress   | statistics such as match count, count of repositories with matches, and duration |
| filters    | suggestions for additional filters to further narrow down the search             |
| alert      | info, warning and error messages                                                 |
| done       | always the last event                                                            |

Refer to the [interface definitions of our typescript client](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/client/shared/src/search/stream.ts?L12) to learn about the schema of the event-types.

## Example (curl)

On Sourcegraph.com we can run queries without authentication.

```shellsession
$ curl --header "Accept: text/event-stream" \
     --get \
     --url "https://sourcegraph.com/.api/search/stream" \
     --data-urlencode "q=r:sourcegraph/sourcegraph doResults count:1"

## FAQ

### Q: How can I run an exhaustive search directly against the Stream API?

To search a pattern over all indexed repositories, add `count:all` and remove all repo filters. For example, to search all indexed repositories for the string "secret", you can run the following command

```bash
curl --header "Accept:text/event-stream" --get --url "https://sourcegraph.com/.api/search/stream" --data-urlencode "q=secret count:all"
```

If you don't want to write your own client, you can also use Sourcegraph's [src-cli](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli).

```bash
src search -stream "secret count:all"
```

### Q: Are there plans for supporting a streaming client or interface with more functionality (e.g., parallelizing multiple streaming requests or aggregating results from multiple streams)?

There are currently no plans to support additional client-side functionality to interact with a streaming endpoint. We recommend users write their own scripts or client wrappers that handle, e.g., firing multiple requests, accepting and aggregating the return values, and additional result formatting or processing.
