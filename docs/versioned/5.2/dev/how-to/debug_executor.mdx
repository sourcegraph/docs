# Debugging executors

This documents how to debug firecracker executors using GCP VMs since that doesn't work on Mac.

First, create a VM in GCP that allows nested virtualization: 

```bash
gcloud compute instances create \
  executors-test \
  --enable-nested-virtualization \
  --zone=us-central1-a \
  --min-cpu-platform="Intel Haswell" \
  --project <YOUR_PROJECT> \
  --boot-disk-size=50GB
```

Then, connect to the instance via ssh: 

```bash
gcloud compute ssh \
  --zone "us-central1-a" \
  --tunnel-through-iap \
  --project <YOUR_PROJECT> \
  executors-test
```

Configure go to cross-compile a binary for linux amd64:

```bash
export GO111MODULE=on
export GOARCH=amd64
export GOOS=linux
export CGO_ENABLED=0
```

Build a go binary of executor for linux: 

```bash
cd cmd/executor \
  && go build \
    -trimpath \
    -buildmode exe \
    -tags dist \
    -o executor github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/cmd/executor
```

Copy the binary onto our new VM:

```bash
gcloud compute scp 
  --tunnel-through-iap \
  --project <YOUR_PROJECT> \
  --zone us-central1-a \
  executor <YOUR_USER>@executors-test:~/executor
```

There is some more general info on how to set up a generic VM with the executor binary in linux, 
using firecracker [here](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/executors/deploy_executors_binary),
but it can be summarized as:
- Install docker, git, and binutils
- Set env vars `EXECUTOR_FRONTEND_URL`, `EXECUTOR_FRONTEND_PASSWORD`, `EXECUTOR_QUEUE_NAME`, `EXECUTOR_USE_FIRECRACKER`
- Run `executor install all` (until here, everything only needs to happen once, unless you change the setup)
- Run executor with `executor run`

At this point, if you go to the sourcegraph instance that itâ€™s connected to,
you should see it appear in the executors site admin page, and also see it
successfully pick up jobs with firecracker VMs enabled. 

Pro tip: `executor test-vm` spins up a long lived firecracker VM for you the same way (networking,
disk, etc) it would during the job so you can inspect it, ssh into it and try
things out. Warning: they get pruned when the actual executor is running, as it
finds them as oprhaned VMs. 

Finally, to clean up after yourself when done: 

```bash
gcloud compute instances delete \
  --zone=us-central1-a \
  --project sourcegraph-dogfood \
  executors-test
```
