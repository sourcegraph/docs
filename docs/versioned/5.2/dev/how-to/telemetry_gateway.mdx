# How to set up Telemetry Gateway locally

Telemetry Gateway is a managed service that ingests events exported from Sourcegraph instances, manipulates them as needed, and exports them to designated Pub/Sub topics or other destinations for processing.

It exposes a gRPC API defined in [`telemetrygateway/v1`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/tree/main/internal/telemetrygateway/v1), and the service itself is implemented in [`cmd/telemetry-gateway`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/tree/main/cmd/telemetry-gateway).

To learn more about the Sourcegraph's new Telemetry framework, refer to [the telemetry documentation](/dev/background-information/telemetry/).

> NOTE: In the Sourcegraph application, the [new events being exported using `internal/telemetry`](/dev/background-information/telemetry/) are sometimes loosely referred to as "V2", as it supersedes the existing mechanisms of writing directly to the `event_logs` database table.
> The *Telemetry Gateway* schema, however, is `telemetrygateway/v1`, as it is the first iteration of the service's API.

## Running Telemetry Gateway locally

Exports of [telemetry events](/dev/background-information/telemetry/) to a locally running Telemetry Gateway instance that is started as part of `sg start` and `sg start dotcom` are enabled by default in development using the `TELEMETRY_GATEWAY_EXPORTER_EXPORT_ADDR` environment variable configured in `sg.config.yaml`.
By default, the local Telemetry Gateway instance will simply log any events it receives at `debug` level without forwarding the events anywhere.

To see the message payloads it *would* emit in a production environment, configure the log level in `sg.config.overwrite.yaml`:

```yaml
commands:
  telemetry-gateway:
    env:
      SRC_LOG_LEVEL: debug
```

You can increase the frequency of exports to monitor behaviour closer to real-time by setting the following in `sg.config.yaml`:

```yaml
env:
  TELEMETRY_GATEWAY_EXPORTER_EXPORT_INTERVAL: "10s"
```

In development, a gRPC interface is enabled for Telemetry Gateway as well at `http://127.0.0.1:10085/debug/grpcui/`.

## Testing against a remote Telemetry Gateway

A test deployment is available at `telemetry-gateway.sgdev.org`, which publishes events to a test topic and development pipeline - currently [`sourcegraph-telligent-testing/event-telemetry-test`](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/topic/edit/event-telemetry-test?project=sourcegraph-telligent-testing).
In local development, you can configure Sourcegraph to export to this test deployment by setting the following in `sg.config.yaml`:

```yaml
env:
  TELEMETRY_GATEWAY_EXPORTER_EXPORT_ADDR: "https://telemetry-gateway.sgdev.org:443"
```
