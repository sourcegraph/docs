# Code Insights Pings

Code Insights pings allow us to quantitatively measure the usage and success of Code Insights. This page is a source of truth for detailed explanations, statuses, and implementations of our pings.

We keep this docs page up to date because pings are a vital component of our product knowledge and prioritization process, and a broken or incorrect ping impacts 3-5 months of data (because that's how long a fix takes to propagate).

**Type:** FE/BE event

**Intended purpose:** Why does this ping exist?

**Functional implementation:** When does this event fire?

**Other considerations:** Anything worth noting.

## Terminology

- **FE event** - log events that we send by calling standard telemetry service on the frontend. These pings live only in the `event_logs` table. These typically represent user actions, such as hovers.
- **BE capture** - pings that our BE sends to the ping store by checking/selecting data from database tables. Our backend periodically sends these pings to the `event_logs` table. These typically represent absolute counts across the entire instance.

## Metrics

### Additions count, edits count, and removals count

### Code Insights View/Click Creation Funnels

**Type:** FE event

**Intended purpose:** These pings allow us to both understand how the view/click/view/click conversion funnel works for the creation flows of all existing types of insights, as well as smell-check other pings. The reason we use both "view" and "button clicks" in this funnel is that it's possible to view a page without "funneling through" via the prior page's CTA (for example: you can reach the creation/edit screen by the "edit" button, which does not involve logging a click on the "create search insight" button).

**Functional implementation:** These events fire on the frontend when the user takes the below actions.

**Other considerations:**

- Aggregation: By week
- Event Code:
   - For the "search insight" funnel: (1) [ViewCodeInsightsCreationPage](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+ViewCodeInsightsCreationPage&patternType=regexp), (2) [CodeInsightCreateSearchBasedInsightClick](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+CodeInsightsCreateSearchBasedInsightClick&patternType=regexp), (3) [ViewSearchBasedCreationPage](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+SearchBasedCreationPage&patternType=regexp), (4.1) [SearchBasedCreationPageSubmitClick](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+SearchBasedCreationPageSubmit&patternType=regexp) OR (4.2) [SearchBasedCreationPageCancelClick](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+SearchBasedCreationPageCancelClick&patternType=regexp)

### View series counts

**Type:** BE capture

**Intended purpose:** To track the number of view series, grouped by presentation type and generation method. Note: a "view series" differs from a "series" by being attached to a particular insight. A series can be attached to more than one insight.

- **Version added:** 3.34
{/* <!-- - **Version(s) broken:**  --> */}

### View counts

**Type:** BE capture

**Intended purpose:** To track the number of insight views, grouped by presentation type.

**Functional implementation:** This is calculated using the `insight_view` table. Unlike critical telemetry which only [shows the number of unlocked insights](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/internal/insights/background/pings/insights_ping_aggregators.go?L286) for customers without full access, this ping [shows the total number that are locked or unlocked](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/internal/insights/background/pings/insights_ping_aggregators.go?L243-247) (and may have been created during a trial or free beta phase).

**Other considerations:** N/A

{/* <!-- - **Version(s) broken:**  --> */}

### Total orgs with dashboards

**Type:** BE capture

**Intended purpose:** To track the number of orgs with at least one dashboard.

**Functional implementation:** This is calculated using the `dashboard_grants` table.

**Other considerations:** N/A

- Event Code: [TotalDashboardCount](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+TotalDashboardCount&patternType=literal)
- **Version added:** 3.38
{/* <!-- - **Version(s) broken:**  --> */}

### Insights per dashboard

**Type:** BE capture

**Intended purpose:** To track statistics (average, min, max, median, std dev,) about how many insights are on each dashboard.

**Functional implementation:** These are calculated using the `dashboard_insight_view` table.

**Other considerations:** N/A

- Aggregation: total
- Event Code: [InsightsPerDashboard](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+InsightsPerDashboard&patternType=literal)
- **Version added:** 3.38
{/* <!-- - **Version(s) broken:**  --> */}

### Series backfill time

- **Version added:** 4.1

### Data export requests

**Type:** BE capture

**Intended purpose:** To track usage of data exporting functionality.

**Functional implementation:** Telemetry events are fired when a request reaches the backend HTTP handler, whether that comes from the webapp or the CLI.

**Other considerations:** The ping name contains `click` but this does indeed also record events from the CLI.

- Aggregation: weekly
- Event Code: [WeeklyDataExportClicks](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+WeeklyDataExportClicks&patternType=standard), `InsightsDataExportRequest` in `event_logs`
- **Version added:** 5.0
