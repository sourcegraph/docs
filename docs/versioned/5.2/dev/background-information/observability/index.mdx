# Developing observability

This documentation is for generalized, usecase-agnostic development of Sourcegraph's observability.
Sourcegraph employees should also refer to the [handbook's observability section](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/engineering/observability) for Sourcegraph-specific documentation.

> NOTE: For how to *use* Sourcegraph's observability and an overview of our observability features, refer to the [observability for site administrators documentation](/admin/observability/).

## Overview

Observability at Sourcegraph includes:

|                |              Description               |                   Examples                    |
| :------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Monitoring** | how you know _when_ something is wrong | Dashboards & metrics, alerting, health checks |
| **Debugging**  | how you debug _what_ is wrong          | Tracing, logging                              |
