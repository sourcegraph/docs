## Quickstart

In order to run the Sourcegraph locally, the following pages will guide you from zero to having a local environment up and running, ready for contributions for the the most common use cases.

- [**Quickstart with `sg`**](/dev/setup/quickstart)

The quick start guide above provides a standard approach, focused on simplicity and accessiblility. But it's not the only way, the dependencies page below documents more exhaustively various approaches to set them up.
