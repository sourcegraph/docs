## Code Search

### Does Code Search work with my repositories?

Code Search works with all your repositories. Likewise, you can also [search through our public code](https://sourcegraph.com/search) that has a 2 million+ open source codebase.

### Who can search my code?

Public code is searchable by anyone, but your private code can be searched only by users who have access to it.

### Do I need to enable Code Navigation?

No, the default search-based code navigation works out of the box without any configuration. However, for an advanced and customized navigation experience your site admin will set up precise code navigation.

### What is the max file size limit for Code Search?

By default, files larger than **1 MB** are excluded from search results.

### What programming languages are supported?

Code Search supports almost all programming languages: Java, Python, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#/C/C++, Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, Ruby, Scala, Rust, Perl, Dart, Erlang, COBOL, Clojure, Lisp, Shell, Terraform, Lua, GraphQL, Thrift, Protobuf, YAML, JSON, Jsonnet, R, PHP, Elixir, Haskell, PowerShell, OCaml, CUDA, Pascal, Verilog, VHDL, Groovy, and Tcl.

### What deployment options are available with Code Search?

Code Search supports the following deployment options: Kubernetes cluster, Amazon EKS or EC2, Google GKE, Microsoft, Azure AKS, Docker Compose, and Docker Compose in GCP. Read more about our [deployment docs here](/admin/deploy).

## Code Navigation

## Why are my results sometimes incorrect?

If an index is not found for a particular file in a repository, Sourcegraph will fall back to search-based code navigation. You may occasionally see results from search-based code navigation even when you have uploaded an index. This can happen in the following scenarios:

The line containing the symbol was created or edited between the nearest indexed commit and the commit being browsed.
The Find references panel may include search-based results, but only after all of the precise results have been displayed. This ensures every symbol has useful code navigation.

## What languages are supported?

Search-based code navigation supports 40 programming languages, including all of the most popular ones: Apex, Clojure, Cobol, C++, C#, CSS, Cuda, Dart, Elixir, Erlang, Go, GraphQL, Groovy, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Jsonnet, Kotlin, Lisp, Lua, OCaml, Pascal, Perl, PHP, PowerShell, Protobuf, Python, R, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Shell, Starlark, Strato, Swift, Tcl, Thrift, TypeScript, Verilog, VHDL.

### Why does it sometimes time out?

The [symbol search](/code-search/types/symbol) performance section describes query paths and performance. Consider using [Rockskip](/code-search/code-navigation/rockskip) if you're experiencing frequent timeouts.
