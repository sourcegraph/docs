# User surveys

Sourcegraph periodically surveys users for feedback. The results are visible to site admins and Sourcegraph. The survey questions are:

- How likely is it that you would recommend Sourcegraph to a friend?
- What do you use Sourcegraph for?
- How can we make Sourcegraph better?
- What is the most important reason for the score you gave Sourcegraph?

## Gathering survey feedback

After a user has been active on Sourcegraph for 3 days, they are shown the survey in the bottom right corner of the page. A user can temporarily or permanently dismiss the survey. Every 30 days, the user will be shown the survey again (unless they have permanently dismissed it).

A user can also visit `https://sourcegraph.example.com/survey` to submit survey feedback at any time.

## View survey responses

Responses to this survey are visible to all site admins on the Sourcegraph instance. View all responses on the **Site admin > User surveys** page. (The URL is `https://sourcegraph.example.com/site-admin/surveys`.)
