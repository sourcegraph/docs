# SMTP and email delivery

Sourcegraph uses an SMTP server of your choosing to send emails for:

- [Code Monitoring](/code_monitoring/) notifications
- Inviting other users to a Sourcegraph instance, or to an organization/team on a Sourcegraph instance
- Important updates to a user accounts (for example, creation of API keys)
- For [`builtin` authentication](/admin/auth/#builtin-password-authentication), password resets and email verification

> NOTE: Sourcegraph Cloud customers can take advantage of mananged SMTP servers - [learn more](/cloud/#managed-smtp).

## User email verification

Many emails delivered from a Sourcegraph instance to a user requires that the user's primary email address be verified.
This helps prevent Sourcegraph from sending product emails to invalid or inactive email addresses.

Users that create accounts through an external [authentication provider](/admin/auth/), such as GitHub or SAML, will automatically have verified email addresses from the external provider.

When SMTP is configured, users that sign up through [`builtin` authentication](/admin/auth/#builtin-password-authentication) will have the emails they sign up with marked as unverified.
To verify their email address, the user can do one of the following:

- Click the "set password" link they receive in their email
- In the "Emails" tab of their account, click "Send verification email"
- Ask a site admin to verify their email manually through the "Emails" tab of their account, or through the `setUserEmailVerified` GraphQL mutation

Users with emails [created by the site admin](/admin/auth/#creating-builtin-authentication-users) through the `/site-admin/users/new` UI will have the same behaviour as the above. Users created directly through GraphQL or the `src` CLI assume that the email provided is verified.

> Note: For SSO (Single Sign-On) enabled instances, it is important to remove the basic authentication method from the `auth.providers` list to prevent users from receiving password reset links. This is because users do not need passwords to log in to SSO-enabled instances. Prior to disabling the basic authentication method, please ensure that there is at least one administrator account capable of signing in via SSO. This is essential because once basic authentication is disabled, the username/password combination used to create the initial admin account will no longer be functional.

## Configuring Sourcegraph to send email via Amazon AWS / SES

To use Amazon SES with Sourcegraph, first [follow these steps to create an SES account for Sourcegraph](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-smtp-software-package.html).

Navigate to your site configuration (e.g. `https://sourcegraph.com/site-admin/configuration`) and fill in the configuration:

```jsonc
{
  // [...]
  "email.senderName": "Example Sourcegraph Instance", // Default: Sourcegraph
  "email.address": "from@example.com",
  "email.smtp": {
    "authentication": "PLAIN",
    "username": "<SES SMTP username>",
    "password": "<SES SMTP password>",
    "host": "email-smtp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com",
    "port": 587
  }
}
```

Please note that the configured `email.address` (the from address) must be a verified address with SES, see [this page for details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/verify-addresses-and-domains.html).

## Configuring Sourcegraph to send email via Google Workspace / GMail

To use Google Workspace with Sourcegraph, you will need to [create an SMTP Relay account](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2956491). Be sure to choose `Require SMTP Authentication` and `Require TLS encryption` in step 7.

Navigate to your site configuration (e.g. `https://sourcegraph.com/site-admin/configuration`) and fill in the configuration:

```jsonc
{
  // [...]
  "email.senderName": "Example Sourcegraph Instance", // Default: Sourcegraph
  "email.address": "test@example.com",
  "email.smtp": {
    "authentication": "PLAIN",
    "username": "test@example.com",
    "password": "<YOUR SECRET>",
    "host": "smtp-relay.gmail.com",
    "port": 587,
    "domain": "example.com"
  }
}
```

Make sure that `test@example.com` in both places of the configuration matches the email address of the account you created, and that `<YOUR SECRET>` is replaced with the account password or app password when 2FA enabled.

## Configuring Sourcegraph to send email using another provider

Other providers such as Mailchimp and Sendgrid may also be used with Sourcegraph. Any valid SMTP server account should do. For those two providers in specific, you may follow their documentation:

* https://mailchimp.com/developer/transactional/docs/smtp-integration/
* https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/getting-started-smtp

Once you have an SMTP account, simply navigate to your site configuration (e.g. `https://sourcegraph.com/site-admin/configuration`) and fill in the configuration:

```jsonc
{
  // [...]
  "email.senderName": "Example Sourcegraph Instance", // Default: Sourcegraph
  "email.address": "from@example.com",
  "email.smtp": {
    "authentication": "PLAIN",
    "username": "test@example.com",
    "password": "<YOUR SECRET>",
    "host": "smtp-server.example.com",
    "port": 587
  }
}
```

A few helpful tips:

* `email.address` is the email Sourcegraph will send email `FROM`. Make sure your account has privilege to send mail from that address.
* You should use a TLS/SSL enabled port, either `587` or `2525`. Any port number is allowed, though.
* The following `authentication` types are allowed: `PLAIN` (default), `CRAM-MD5`, and `none`
* If a `HELO` domain is required, simply add `"domain": "<the domain>",` under `email.smtp`
* TLS certificate verification can be disabled if your SMTP server does not have a valid TLS cert. To do so, set `"noVerifyTLS": true,` (this is not recommended and may be a security risk)

## Sending a test email

(Added in Sourcegraph v3.38)

To verify email sending is working correctly, visit the GraphQL API console at e.g. `https://sourcegraph.example.com/api/console` and then run the following query replacing `test@example.com` with your personal email address:

```graphql
mutation {
  sendTestEmail(to: "test@example.com")
}
```

If everything is successfully configured, you should see a response like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "sendTestEmail": "Sent test email to \"test@example.com\" successfully! Please check it was received."
  }
}
```

Otherwise, you should see an error with more information:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "sendTestEmail": "Failed to send test email: mail: ..."
  }
}
```
