# Instance Size

When sizing your Sourcegraph deployment, it is important to take into account the number of users and repositories in your environment. Below is our sizing chart with our sizing recommendations for different size environments.

## Size chart

If you fall between two sizes, choose the larger of the two. For example:

1. If you have 8,000 users with 80,000 repositories, your instance size would be **L**.
2. If you have 1,000 users with 80,000 repositories, your instance size would still be **L**.

|                  |    **XS**     |     **S**      |     **M**      |     **L**      |     **XL**     |
|:-----------------|:-------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| **Users**        |   Up to 500   |  Up to 1,000   |  Up to 5,000   |  Up to 10,000  |  Up to 20,000  |
| **Repositories** |  Up to 5,000  |  Up to 10,000  |  Up to 50,000  | Up to 100,000  | Up to 250,000  |
| **vCPU**         |       8       |       16       |       32       |       48       |       96       |
| **Memory (GB)**  |      32       |       64       |      128       |      192       |      384       |
| **SSD Required** |      Yes      |      Yes       |      Yes       |      Yes       |      Yes       |

We recommend the following instance type for the cloud providers listed below:

|           |    **XS**     |     **S**      |     **M**      |     **L**      |     **XL**     |
|:----------|:-------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| **AWS**   |  m6a.2xlarge  |  m6a.4xlarge   |  m6a.8xlarge   |  m6a.12large   |  m6a.24xlarge  |
| **Azure** |     D8_v3     |     D16_v3     |     D32_v3     |     D48_v3     |     D64_v3     |
| **GCP**   | n2-standard-8 | n2-standard-16 | n2-standard-32 | n2-standard-48 | n2-standard-96 |


### Kubernetes

Follow the instructions for each provider linked in the table below to provision a Kubernetes cluster for the
infrastructure provider of your choice. Use the recommended node and list types in the
table.

| **Provider**                                                                                 | **Node type**                   | **Boot/ephemeral disk size** |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|
| [Amazon EKS (better than plain EC2)](/admin/deploy/kubernetes/eks)                           | m5.4xlarge                      | 100 GB (SSD preferred)       |
| [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart) | n2-standard-16                  | 100 GB (default)             |
| [Azure](/admin/deploy/kubernetes/azure)                                                      | D16 v3                          | 100 GB (SSD preferred)       |
| [Other](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/turnkey-solutions/)          | 16 vCPU, 60 GiB memory per node | 100 GB (SSD preferred)       |


<Callout type="note">Sourcegraph can run most standard Kubernetes clusters, so if your infrastructure provider is not listed, see the "Other" row.</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">If you are deploying on Azure, you **must** ensure that your cluster is created with support for CSI storage driver(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/csi-storage-drivers). This **can not** be enabled after the fact.</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">If you intend to set this up as a production instance, we recommend you create the cluster in a VPC or other secure network that restricts unauthenticated access from the public Internet. You can later expose the necessary ports via an [Internet Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html) or an equivalent mechanism. Note that Sourcegraph must expose port 443 for outbound traffic to code hosts and to enable [telemetry](/admin/pings) with Sourcegraph.com. Additionally, port 22 may be opened to enable git SSH cloning by Sourcegraph. Take care to secure your cluster in a manner that meets your organization's security requirements.</Callout>

## Resources

Please refer to our [resource estimator](/admin/deploy/resource_estimator) for more information regarding resources allocation for your Sourcegraph deployment.
