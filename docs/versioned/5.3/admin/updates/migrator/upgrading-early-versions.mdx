# Upgrading Early Versions

This document provides advise on multiversion upgrades starting from `v4.0.0` and earlier.

Reminders:
- Except in the case of the `up` command, always run `migrator` commands with the most recent release image.
- Always refer to the [upgrade notes](/admin/updates/#upgrades-index) for the versions you'll pass over in the case of a multiversion upgrade.

## Before v4.0.0

The `upgrade` `migrator` command is introduced in `v4.0.0`, just remember to use the latest version of the `migrator` image released during a multiversion upgrade and you'll have access to the most up to date `migtrator` commands.

## Before v3.37.0

In `v3.37.0` the `migrator` service was introduced. Docker-compose and Kubernetes instances hoping to upgrade from versions before the introduction of migrator will need to create the `migrator` manifest in order to run `migrator` commands.
- In Docker-compose add the [migrator service](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/master/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml#LL3C1-L53C35) to the top of your `docker-compose.yaml` file and follow the [multiversion upgrade proceedure](/admin/deploy/docker-compose/upgrade#multi-version-upgrades).
- In kubernetes deployments you'll need to create the [`migrator.Job.yaml` job manifest](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph/blob/master/configure/migrator/migrator.Job.yaml) and use it as described in the [multiversion upgrade procedure](/admin/deploy/kubernetes/upgrade#multi-version-upgrades).
> Note: *It may be more effective in some cases to `git checkout` a later version of Sourcegraph to get access to `migrator` manifests and invoke migrator this was before checking back out your `release` branch and proceeding with the upgrade.*

## Before v3.27.0

In version `3.27` `pgsql` and `codeintel-db` databases were upgraded from Postgres 11 to Postgres 12. **If upgrading from 3.26 or before to 3.27 or later**, the `pgsql` and `codeintel-db` databases must have their Postgres version upgraded. If this step is not performed, then the following upgrade procedure will fail fast (and leave all existing data untouched).
  - If using an external database, follow the [upgrading external PostgreSQL instances](/admin/postgres#upgrading-external-postgresql-instances) guide.
  - Otherwise, perform the following steps from the [upgrading internal Postgres instances](/admin/postgres#upgrading-internal-postgresql-instances) guide.

The following procedures decribe how to upgrade the Postgres version:

### Docker-compose postgres version upgrade

1. It's assumed that your fork of `deploy-sourcegraph-docker` is up to date with your instance's current version. Pull the upstream changes for `v3.27.0` and resolve any git merge conflicts. We need to temporarily boot the containers defined at this specific version to rewrite existing data to the new Postgres 12 format.
2. Run `docker-compose up pgsql` to launch new Postgres 12 containers and rewrite the old Postgres 11 data. This may take a while, but streaming container logs should show progress.
3. Wait until the database container is accepting connections. Once ready, run the command `docker exec pgsql -- psql -U sg -c 'REINDEX database sg;'` to repair indexes that were silently invalidated by the previous data rewrite step. **If you skip this step**, then some data may become inaccessible under normal operation, the following steps are not guaranteed to work, and **data loss will occur**.
4. Follow the same steps for the `codeintel-db`:
   - Run `docker-compose up codeintel-db` to launch Postgres 12.
   - Run `docker exec codeintel-db -- pgsql -U sg -c 'REINDEX database sg;'` to reindex the database.

### Kubernetes postgres version upgrade

1. It's assumed that your fork of `deploy-sourcegraph` is up to date with your instance's current version. Pull upstream changes for `v3.27.0` and resolve any git merge conflicts. We need to temporarily boot the containers defined in this specific version to rewrite existing data to the new Postgres 12 format.
2. Run `kubectl apply -l deploy=sourcegraph -f base/pgsql` to launch a new Postgres 12 container and rewrite the Postgres 11 data. This may take a while, but streaming container logs should show progress.
> **NOTE**: *The Postgres migration requires enough capacity in its attached volume to accommodate an additional copy of the data currently on disk. Resize the volume now if necessaryâ€”the container will fail to start if there is not enough free disk space.*
3. Wait until the database container is accepting connections. Once ready, run the command `kubectl exec pgsql -- psql -U sg -c 'REINDEX database sg;'` issue a reindex command to Postgres to repair indexes that were silently invalidated by previous data rewrite step. **If you skip this step**, then some data may become inaccessible under normal operation, following steps are not guaranteed to work, and **data loss will occur**.
4. Follow the same steps for the `codeintel-db`:
   - Run `kubectl apply -l deploy=sourcegraph -f base/codeintel-db` to launch Postgres 12.
   - Run `kubectl exec codeintel-db -- psql -U sg -c 'REINDEX database sg;'` to issue a reindex command to Postgres,
5. Leave these versions of the databases running while the subsequent migration steps are performed. If `codeinsights-db` is a container new to your instance, now is a good time to start it as well.
