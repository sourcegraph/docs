# Search and replace specific terms

Create a batch change that changes wording in every repository.

### Introduction

This tutorial shows you how to create [a batch spec](/batch_changes/explanations/introduction_to_batch_changes#batch-spec) that replaces the words `whitelist` and `blacklist` with `allowlist` and `denylist` in every Markdown file across your entire code base.

The batch spec can be easily changed to search and replace other terms in other file types.

### Prerequisites

We recommend using the latest version of Sourcegraph when working with Batch Changes and that you have a basic understanding of how to create batch specs and run them. See the following documents for more information:

1. ["Quickstart"](/batch_changes/quickstart)
1. ["Introduction to Batch Changes"](/batch_changes/explanations/introduction_to_batch_changes)

### Create the batch spec

Save the following batch spec YAML as `allowlist-denylist.batch.yaml`:

```yaml
name: use-allowlist-denylist-wording
description: This batch change updates our Markdown docs to use the terms "allowlist" and "denylist" instead of "whitelist" and "blacklist".

# Search for repositories in which the term "whitelist" or "blacklist" appears
# in Markdown files.
on:
  - repositoriesMatchingQuery: whitelist OR blacklist lang:markdown -file:vendor -file:node_modules

# In each repository
steps:
  # find all * or *.markdown files, that are not in a vendor or node_modules
  # folder, and replace the terms in them:
  - run: |
      find . -type f \( -name '*' -or -name '*.markdown' \) -not -path "*/vendor/*" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" |\
      xargs sed -i 's/whitelist/allowlist/g; s/blacklist/denylist/g'
    container: alpine:3

# Describe the changeset (e.g., GitHub pull request) you want for each repository.
changesetTemplate:
  title: Replace whitelist/blacklist with allowlist/denylist
  body: This replaces the terms whitelist/blacklist in Markdown files with allowlist/denylist
  branch: batch-changes/allowlist-denylist # Push the commit to this branch.
  commit:
    message: Replace whitelist/blacklist with allowlist/denylist
  published: false
```

### Create the batch change

1. In your terminal, run this command:

    <pre>src batch preview -f use-allowlist-denylist-wording.batch.yaml</pre>
1. Wait for it to run and compute the changes for each repository.
    <img src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/batch_changes/use_allowlist_denylist_wording_wait_run.png" />
1. Open the preview URL that the command printed out.
    <img src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/batch_changes/use_allowlist_denylist_wording_click_url.png" />
1. Examine the preview. Confirm that the changes are what you intended. If not, edit your batch spec and then rerun the command above.
    <img src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/batch_changes/use_allowlist_denylist_wording_preview.png" />
1. Click the **Apply** button to create the batch change.
1. Feel free to then publish the changesets (i.e. create pull requests and merge requests) by [modifying the `published` attribute in the batch spec](/batch_changes/references/batch_spec_yaml_reference#changesettemplate-published) and re-running the `src batch preview` command.

### Using `ruplacer` to replace terms in multiple case styles

With [ruplacer](https://github.com/TankerHQ/ruplacer) we can easily search and replace terms in multiple case styles: `white_list`, `WhiteList`, `WHITE_LIST` etc.

The easiest way to use `ruplacer` in our batch spec would look like this:

```yaml
steps:
  - run: |
      find . -type f \( -name '*' -or -name '*.markdown' \) -not -path "*/vendor/*" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" >> /tmp/find_result.txt \
      && cat /tmp/find_result.txt | while read file;
      do
        ruplacer --subvert whitelist allowlist --go ${file} || echo "nothing to replace";
        ruplacer --subvert blacklist denylist --go ${file} || echo "nothing to replace";
      done
    container: keegancsmith/ruplacer
```

Save the file and run the `src batch preview` command from above again to use `ruplacer` to replace variations of terms.

Alternatively if you want to run it on all files:

```yaml
steps:
  - run: |
      ruplacer --subvert whitelist allowlist --go || echo "nothing to replace"
      ruplacer --subvert blacklist denylist --go  || echo "nothing to replace"
    container: keegancsmith/ruplacer
```
