# Updating Go import statements using Comby

### Introduction

This batch change rewrites Go import paths for the `log15` package from `gopkg.in/inconshreveable/log15.v2` to `github.com/inconshreveable/log15` using [Comby](https://comby.dev/).

It can handle single-package import statements like this one:

```go
import "gopkg.in/inconshreveable/log15.v2"
```

Single-package imports with an alias:


```go
import log15 "gopkg.in/inconshreveable/log15.v2"
```

And multi-package import statements with or without an alias:

```go
import (
	"io"

	"github.com/pkg/errors"
	"gopkg.in/inconshreveable/log15.v2"
)
```

### Prerequisites

We recommend that use the latest version of Sourcegraph when working with Batch Changes and that you have a basic understanding of how to create batch specs and run them. See the following documents for more information:

1. ["Quickstart"](/batch_changes/quickstart)
1. ["Introduction to Batch Changes"](/batch_changes/explanations/introduction_to_batch_changes)

### Create the batch spec

Save the following batch spec YAML as `update-log15-import.batch.yaml`:

```yaml
name: update-log15-import
description: This batch change updates Go import paths for the `log15` package from `gopkg.in/inconshreveable/log15.v2` to `github.com/inconshreveable/log15` using [Comby](https://comby.dev/)

# Find all repositories that contain the import we want to change.
on:
  - repositoriesMatchingQuery: lang:go gopkg.in/inconshreveable/log15.v2

# In each repository
steps:
  # we first replace the import when it's part of a multi-package import statement
  - run: comby -in-place 'import (:[before]"gopkg.in/inconshreveable/log15.v2":[after])' 'import (:[before]"github.com/inconshreveable/log15":[after])' .go -matcher .go -exclude-dir .,vendor
    container: comby/comby
  # ... and when it's a single import line.
  - run: comby -in-place 'import:[alias]"gopkg.in/inconshreveable/log15.v2"' 'import:[alias]"github.com/inconshreveable/log15"' .go -matcher .go -exclude-dir .,vendor
    container: comby/comby

# Describe the changeset (e.g., GitHub pull request) you want for each repository.

```

### Create the batch change

1. In your terminal, run this command:

    <pre>src batch preview -f update-log15-import.batch.yaml</pre>
1. Wait for it to run and compute the changes for each repository.
1. Open the preview URL that the command printed out.
1. Examine the preview. Confirm that the changesets are the ones you intended to track. If not, edit the batch spec and then rerun the command above.
1. Click the **Apply** button to create the batch change.
1. Feel free to then publish the changesets (i.e. create pull requests and merge requests) by [modifying the `published` attribute in the batch spec](/batch_changes/references/batch_spec_yaml_reference#changesettemplate-published) and re-running the `src batch preview` command.
