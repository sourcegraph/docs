# Requirements

Code Insights has requirements for the Sourcegraph server version, its deployment type, and its connected code hosts.

## Sourcegraph server

While the latest version of Sourcegraph server is always recommended:

- Version 3.28 is the minimum version required to use Code Insights over individual repositories
- Version 3.31.1 is the minimum version required to use Code Insights over all repositories

## Sourcegraph deployment

You can only use Code Insights on a [Docker Compose](/admin/deploy/docker-compose/) or [Kubernetes](/admin/deploy/kubernetes/) Sourcegraph deployment.

## Code hosts

Sourcegraph Code Insights is compatible with any [Sourcegraph-compatible code host](/admin/repo/), except:

* Perforce repositories making use of sub-repo permissions are not supported
