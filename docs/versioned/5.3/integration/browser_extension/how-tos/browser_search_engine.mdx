## Adding Sourcegraph as a browser search engine

### With the Sourcegraph browser extension (recommended)

The easiest way is to install the [Sourcegraph browser extension](/integration/browser_extension/quickstart), which automatically configures the location bar `src` shortcut to search Sourcegraph.

### Google Chrome

1. Perform a code search on the Sourcegraph instance you want to add as a search engine.
1. Copy the URL of the search results page.
1. Go to `chrome://settings`. Under **Search engine**, click **Manage search engines**. Next to **Other search engines**, click **ADD**.

1. In the **Add search engine** form, paste the URL you copied (in step 1) in the **URL with %s in place of query** field. Insert the string `%s` into the URL's `?q=` query parameter (and remove any parts of the query that you don't want to keep).
2. Fill in the keyword field with the keyboard shortcut you want for searching on Sourcegraph. In this example, it's set to <kbd>s</kbd>.

5.Click **ADD**.

To use the shortcut, focus in the browser address bar, type in the keyword you chose (such as <kbd>src</kbd>), and press <kbd>Tab</kbd>. Now type your Sourcegraph code search query and hit enter. You'll be taken to the search results page on your Sourcegraph instance.

To configure a shortcut (keyword) for quicker access:

1. In the URL bar, enter about:preferences#search
1. Scroll down to **One-Click Search Engines**, double-click the **Keyword** cell for **Sourcegraph** and type in a shortcut (such as <kbd>src</kbd>).

To use the search engine, type `src` `Tab` in the URL bar, then type your Sourcegraph search query. Pressing `Enter` will then go right to Sourcegraph!
