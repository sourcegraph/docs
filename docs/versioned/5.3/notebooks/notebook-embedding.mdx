# Embedding Notebooks

A notebook can be embedded using a standard iframe element. In order for the iframe to load, the user must be logged into Sourcegraph. The notebook embedding URL is an authenticated endpoint.

## Domain considerations

Certain browsers (i.e. Safari and Firefox) block cross-domain cookies from being sent in iframe requests. This will prevent an embedded notebook from being displayed, even when a user is logged into Sourcegraph from the same browser. To ensure that notebook embedding requests will be permitted to load for all of your logged-in Sourcegraph users, the Sourcegraph instance must be hosted on the same domain as the page that loads the iframe element. For Cloud customers, see [Custom Domains](/cloud/#custom-domains).

## How to embed

To create the embedding URL, copy the notebook URL (e.g. `https://your-sourcegraph-instance.com/notebooks/notebook-id`), and add the `/embed` prefix directly before the `/notebooks` segment:

  ```
  https://{your-sourcegraph-instance.com}/embed/notebooks/{notebook-id}
  ```

Once you have the embedding URL, create an iframe element and use the embedding URL as the `src` attribute value. See example iframe below:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://your-sourcegraph-instance.com/embed/notebooks/notebook-id"
  frameborder="0"
  sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups"
></iframe>
```

## Security
We recommend using the `sandbox` attribute to apply extra security restrictions to the iframe. Notebooks require three exceptions: `allow-scripts` allows executing Javascript scripts, `allow-same-origin` allows access to local storage and cookies, and `allow-popups` allows opening links in a separate tab.

## Enable embedding notebooks on private instances
Embedding is disabled by default on private instances. A site-admin can enable embedding by running the following GraphQL mutation in the API console, located at `https://{your-sourcegraph-instance.com}/api/console`:

```graphql
mutation {
  createFeatureFlag(name: "enable-embed-route", value: true) {
    ... on FeatureFlagBoolean {
      name
      value
    }
  }
}
```
