# Setting up Slack notifications

<Callout type="note">This feature is in beta.</Callout>

Slack notifications are supported via webhooks. Webhooks are special URLs that Sourcegraph's Code Monitoring
can call in order to send a message to a Slack channel when there are new search results for a query.
In order to use Slack notifications, you must first create a Slack application in your organization's Slack workspace,
add a webhook for a Slack channel within that application, and then configure a code monitor in Sourcegraph to
use that webhook's URL.

## Prerequisites

- You must not have have the setting `experimentalFeatures.codeMonitoringWebHooks` disabled in your user, org, or global settings.
- You must have permission to create apps inside of your organization's Slack workspace
