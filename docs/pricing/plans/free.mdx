Sourcegraph's Free plan is designed for hobbyists, and light usage is aimed at users with personal projects and small-scale applications.

## Pricing and billing cycle

There is no billing cycle, as it's free to use and supports one user per account. You can upgrade to our Enterprise Starter plan for more advanced features.
