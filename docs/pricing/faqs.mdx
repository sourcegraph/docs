# FAQs

<p className="subtitle">Learn about some of the most commonly asked questions about Sourcegraph.</p>

## What's the difference between Free, Enterprise Starter, and Enterprise plans?

Free is best for individuals working on hobby projects with public code search.

Enterprise Starter is for growing organizations who want Sourcegraph's search experience hosted on our cloud.

Enterprise is for organizations that want AI and search across the SDLC with enterprise-level security, scalability, and flexible deployment.

## What forms of support are available for paid plans?

Email and web portal support is available to both Enterprise Starter and Enterprise customers, and you can [read more about our SLAs](/sla). Premium support with enhanced SLAs is also available as an add-on for Enterprise customers.

## Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?

To upgrade to Enterprise, please [contact our Sales team](https://sourcegraph.com/contact/request-info).

## What's the difference between "flexible LLM options" and "bring your own LLM key"?

Flexible LLM options: Enterprise users with Cody enabled can select from multiple options to use for chat.

Bring your own LLM key: Enterprise customers can optionally provide their own LLM API key for supported LLMs (including for LLM services such as Azure OpenAI and Amazon Bedrock). In this scenario, customers pay for their own LLM consumption, and we will provide a pricing discount with your plan.

## Does Sourcegraph use my code to improve the models used by other people?

For Enterprise customers, Sourcegraph will not train on your company's data unless your instance admin enables fine-tuning, which would customize an existing model exclusively for your use.

## How are active users counted and billed for Cody?

<Callout type="note">This only applies to Cody Enterprise contracts.</Callout>

‍A billable user is one who is signed in to their Enterprise account and actively interacts with the product (e.g., they see suggested autocompletions, run commands or chat with Cody, start new discussions, clear chat history, or copy text from chats, change settings, and more). Simply having Cody installed is not enough to be considered a billable user.

## How are active users calculated for Sourcegraph Code Search and Code Intelligence Platform?

A billable active Code Search or Code Intelligence Platform user is signed into and accesses Sourcegraph. This includes but is not limited to:

- Visiting the Sourcegraph web application or using a browser extension, editor extension, or other client while signed in
- Conducting a search in the Sourcegraph UI or extension
- Hovering and navigating code in the Sourcegraph UI or extension
- Viewing a file or repository in Sourcegraph
- Creating, viewing, or receiving a code monitor
- Creating, viewing, modifying, or applying a batch change
- Creating, viewing, or modifying a code insight
- Creating, viewing, or modifying a search notebook

## How is this measured in the product?

A user who has accessed a Sourcegraph product is counted as active once they complete an action that represents usage reflected above.

User counts and usage metrics are in [Sourcegraph Analytics](../analytics).

## Is my data secure when connected to Code Search?

## What if I want AI or Code Search Enterprise only?

## What are the limits of the Enterprise starter plan?

The Enterprise Starter plan supports up to 50 developers and, alongside a limit of 100 repositories for search and context, also includes 5GB of storage. Adding additional seats gives you 1GB of additional storage per seat, for a maximum total of 10GB.
