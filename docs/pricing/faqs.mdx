# FAQs

<p className= "subtitle">Learn about some of the most commonly asked questions about Sourcegraph.</p>

## What's the difference between Free, Enterprise Starter, and Enterprise plans?

Free is best for individuals working on hobby projects.

Enterprise Starter is for growing organizations who want Sourcegraph's AI & search experience hosted on our cloud.

Enterprise is for organizations that want AI and search across the SDLC with enterprise-level security, scalability, and flexible deployment.

## How are autocompletions counted for the Cody Free plan?

Cody autocompletions are counted based on the number of suggestions served to the user in their IDE as ghost text. This includes all suggestions on whether or not the user accepts them.

## How does Sourcegraph's context and personalization work?

Cody can retrieve codebase context to personalize responses in several ways. For Free and Pro users, context is retrieved from their local repositories.

The Enterprise Starter and Enterprise plans use Sourcegraph's search backend to retrieve context. This method pulls context from a team's full codebase at any scale.

## What forms of support are available for paid plans?

Email and web portal support is available to both Enterprise Starter and Enterprise customers, and you can [read more about our SLAs](/sla). Premium support with enhanced SLAs is also available as an add-on for Enterprise customers.

## Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?

Users can upgrade or downgrade between Free and Pro within their account settings anytime. For Pro users, upgrading to Enterprise Starter is also possible, but doing so currently does not cancel your subscription, and you must cancel it yourself.

To upgrade to Enterprise, please [contact our Sales team](https://sourcegraph.com/contact/request-info).

## What's the difference between "flexible LLM options" and "bring your own LLM key"?

Flexible LLM options: Users can select from multiple options to use for chat.

Bring your own LLM key: Enterprise customers can optionally provide their own LLM API key for supported LLMs (including for LLM services such as Azure OpenAI and Amazon Bedrock). In this scenario, customers pay for their own LLM consumption, and we will provide a pricing discount with your plan.

## Does Sourcegraph use my code to improve the models used by other people?

For Enterprise and Enterprise Starter customers, Sourcegraph will not train on your company's data unless your instance admin enables fine-tuning, which would customize an existing model exclusively for your use.

For Free and Pro users, Sourcegraph may use your data to fine-tune the model you are accessing unless you disable this feature.

## Can Sourcegraph be run fully self-hosted?

Sourcegraph requires cloud-based services to power its AI features. For customers looking for a fully self-hosted or air-gapped solution, please [contact us](https://sourcegraph.com/contact/request-info).

## Is an annual contract required for any of the plans?

Pro and Enterprise Starter plans are billed monthly and can be paid with a credit card.

## How are active users counted and billed?

<Callout type= "note">This only applies to Enterprise contracts. Pro and Enterprise Starter users pay for a seat every month, regardless of usage.</Callout>

‍A billable user is one who is signed in to their Enterprise account and actively interacts with the product (e.g., they see suggested autocompletions, run commands or chat with Cody, start new discussions, clear chat history, or copy text from chats, change settings, and more). Simply having Cody installed is not enough to be considered a billable user.

## How are active users calculated for Sourcegraph Code Search and Code Intelligence Platform?

A billable active Code Search or Code Intelligence Platform user is signed into and accesses Sourcegraph. This includes but is not limited to:

- Visiting the Sourcegraph web application or using a browser extension, editor extension, or other client while signed in
- Conducting a search in the Sourcegraph UI or extension
- Hovering and navigating code in the Sourcegraph UI or extension
- Viewing a file or repository in Sourcegraph
- Creating, viewing, or receiving a code monitor
- Creating, viewing, modifying, or applying a batch change
- Creating, viewing, or modifying a code insight
- Creating, viewing, or modifying a search notebook

## How is this measured in the product?

A user who has accessed a Sourcegraph product is counted as active once they complete an action that represents usage reflected above.

User counts and usage metrics are in [Sourcegraph Analytics](../analytics).

## Is my data secure when connected to Code Search?

Sourcegraph has security and reliability controls built for the most demanding enterprises. To learn more, see our [Security page](https://sourcegraph.netlify.app/security).

## What if I want AI or Code Search Enterprise only?

You can purchase Enterprise plans for AI or Code Search only. [Contact us](https://sourcegraph.com/contact/request-info) to learn more.

## Which code hosts is the Enterprise Starter plan compatible with?

The Enterprise Starter plan is currently compatible with GitHub. Its limit for indexing is 100 repositories for search and context.

## What are the limits of the Enterprise starter plan?

The Enterprise Starter plan supports up to 50 developers and, alongside a limit of 100 repositories for search and context, also includes 5Gb of storage. Adding additional seats gives you 1GB of additional storage per seat, for a maximum total of 10GB.
