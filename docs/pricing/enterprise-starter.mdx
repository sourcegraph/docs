# Enterprise Starter

<p className="subtitle">Learn about the Enterprise Starter plan tailored for individuals and teams wanting private code indexing and search to leverage the Sourcegraph platform better.</p>

The Enterprise Starter plan offers a multi-tenant Sourcegraph instance designed for individuals and teams. It offers the core features of a traditional Sourcegraph instance but with a simplified management experience. This plan provides a fully managed version of Sourcegraph (AI + code search + omnibox, with privately indexed code) through a self-serve flow.

## Team seats

The Enterprise Starter plan is priced at **$19 per month per seat**. You can add or remove team members at any time. Existing Cody Pro users can also sign up for the Enterprise Starter by paying $19 per seat. However, their Cody Pro subscription will neither be upgraded nor canceled. Instead, they will have two live subscriptions.

## Enterprise Starter team roles

The Enterprise Starter plan includes the following team-level roles:

- **Admin**: Has full access to the workspace, including the ability to manage repos, users, billing, and settings
- **Member**: Can access repositories in the workspace and use the supported features

## Billing

Workspaces on the Enterprise Starter plan are billed monthly based on the number of team seats purchased. In case of overdue or failing payment, there is a grace period during which the workspace admins will receive a daily notification to complete the transaction.

If you fail to make the payment after the grace period, your workspace will be deleted, and you will not be able to recover your data.

## Downgrading Enterprise Starter

To downgrade your Enterprise Starter, there are two options:

- Delete the workspace â€” this cancels the subscription, and you lose access to the workspace
- Cancel the workspace subscription from the **Billing** settings. This allows you to access the workspace until the end of the current billing period
