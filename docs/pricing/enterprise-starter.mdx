# Enterprise Starter

<p className="subtitle">Learn about the Enterprise Starter plan tailored for individuals and teams wanting private code indexing and search to leverage the Sourcegraph platform better.</p>

The Enterprise Starter plan offers a multi-tenant Sourcegraph instance designed for individuals and teams. It provides the core features of a traditional Sourcegraph instance but with a simplified management experience. This plan provides a fully managed version of Sourcegraph (AI + code search + omnibox, with privately indexed code) through a self-serve flow.

## Team seats

The Enterprise Starter plan is priced at **$19 per month per seat**. You can add or remove team members at any time. Existing Cody Pro users can also sign up for the Enterprise Starter by paying $19 per seat. However, their Cody Pro subscription will neither be upgraded nor canceled. Instead, they will have two live subscriptions.

## Enterprise Starter team roles

The Enterprise Starter plan includes the following team-level roles:

- **Admin**: Has full access to the workspace, including the ability to manage repos, users, billing, and settings
- **Member**: Can access repositories in the workspace and use the supported features

## Billing

Workspaces on the Enterprise Starter plan are billed monthly based on the number of team seats purchased. In case of overdue or failing payment, there is a grace period during which the workspace admins will receive a daily notification to complete the transaction.

If you fail to make the payment after the grace period, your workspace will be deleted, and you will not be able to recover your data.

## Getting started with workspace

A workspace admin can invite new members to their workspace using their team member's email address. Once the team member accepts the invitation, they will be added to the workspace and assigned the member role. Next, the member is asked to connect and authorize the code host (GitHub) to access the private repositories indexed in your Sourcegraph account.

If you skip this step, the member won't be able to access any of the private repositories they have access to. However, they can still use the public search via the Sourcegraph code search bar.

## Repository Management

From the Repository Management settings, workspace admins can configure various settings for connecting code hosts and indexing repositories in their workspace. You can index up to 100 repos per workspace.

From here, you can:

- Use the public code search to add and index open source repos in your workspace
- Add multiple organizations to index private repos

When you add a new organization, you must authorize access and permission for all repositories or selected ones. To index a repository from your organization,

- Click and select it from the repository list
- Next, from the search bar, type the repo name you are looking for
- Click it to add the repository to your workspace
- The status of the repos will change to **TO BE ADDED** in the right sidebar with a **Save Changes** button
- Next, the repo gets a **QUEUED** status, and it takes some time to process
- Finally, it gets indexed with a **CLONED** status

As you add more repos, you get logs for the number of repos added, storage used, and their status. To remove any repo from your workspace, click the repo name that changes the repo status **TO BE REMOVED**. Click the **Save Changes** button to confirm it.

## Downgrading Enterprise Starter

To downgrade your Enterprise Starter, there are two options:

- Delete the workspace â€” this cancels the subscription, and you lose access to the workspace
- Cancel the workspace subscription from the **Billing** settings. This allows you to access the workspace until the end of the current billing period
