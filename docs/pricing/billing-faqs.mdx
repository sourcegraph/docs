## How do I cancel subscription renewal?

In the **Workspace settings > Billing** page, you are able to cancel the subscription and continue having access to your workspace until the end of your current billing period (that is indicated in the UI).

## How do I cancel subscription and delete my workspace immediately?

In the **Workspace settings > General settings** page, you are able to delete your workspace and you will lose access immediately. This action will also cancel your subscription immediately.

## How is the subscription renewal dates determined?

Your subscription renewals are scheduled to happen at the same day of the month. On shorter months (e.g. day 31 on April that only has 30 days), the last day of the month will be the subscription renewal day instead.

## How do I pay my invoice if my subscription is past due?
