## Subscription admin management

A subscription admin is a user with full access to the subscription in Enterprise Portal. Subscription admins can grant and revoke admin access to other users.

Users can be invited individually or in bulk. If there is no [Sourcegraph Account](/sourcegraph-accounts) associated with an invited user's email address an account will be created for them. Newly created users are sent an email with instructions to reset their password to access Enterprise Portal.
