> Note: Sourcegraph.com is a special instance of Sourcegraph with some different behavior compared to that on Sourcegraph Cloud and self-hosted instances. If you're curious about the differences, search our codebase for [`envvar.SourcegraphDotComMode()`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+envvar.SourcegraphDotComMode%28%29&patternType=keyword).
>
> For example, global searches do not search unindexed code by default on sourcegraph.com, whereas on a cloud or self-hosted instance this isn't the case.

> To learn more about where dotcom handles things differently checkout use of the [SourcegraphDotcomMode](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+%22if+envvar.SourcegraphDotComMode%28%29%22&patternType=keyword) env var in our codebase!
