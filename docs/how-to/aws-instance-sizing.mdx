# AWS Instance Sizing for Sourcegraph

## Instance size chart

Select an instance type according to the number of users and repositories you have using this table. If you fall between two sizes, choose the larger of the two.

For example, if you have 8,000 users with 80,000 repositories, your instance size would be **L**. If you have 1,000 users with 80,000 repositories, you should still go with size **M**.

|                      | **XS**                | **S**                 | **M**                 | **L**                 | **XL**                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| **Users**            | ≥ 500                 | ≥ 1,000               | ≥ 5,000               | ≥ 10,000              | ≥ 20,000               |
| **Repositories**     | ≥ 5,000               | ≥ 10,000              | ≥ 50,000              | ≥ 100,000             | ≥ 250,000              |
| **Recommended Type** | m6a.2xlarge           | m6a.4xlarge           | m6a.8xlarge           | m6a.12xlarge          | m6a.24xlarge           |
| **Minimum Type**     | m6a.2xlarge           | m6a.2xlarge           | m6a.4xlarge           | m6a.8xlarge           | m6a.12xlarge           |

<Callout type="note">While we recommend certain instance types in our sizing chart, the Sourcegraph AMI will dynamically use the resources available on the EC2 instance type it is deployed to, provided the minimum amount of resources needed is available. If you would like to resize your EC2 instance, follow the [upgrade steps](/admin/deploy/machine-images/aws-ami#upgrade) to switch to a more appropriate instance type.</Callout>
