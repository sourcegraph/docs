# Code Navigation

<p className="subtitle">
	Learn how to navigate your code and understand its dependencies with high
	precision.
</p>

Code Navigation helps you quickly understand your code, its dependencies, and symbols within the Sourcegraph file view while making it easier to move through your codebase via:

-   Onboarding to codebases faster with cross-repository code navigation features like [Go to definition](/code-navigation/features#go-to-definition) and [Find references](/code-navigation/features#find-references)
-   Providing complete precise reviews, getting up to speed on unfamiliar code, and determining the impact of code changes with the confidence of compiler-accurate code navigation
-   Determining the root causes quickly with precise code navigation that tracks references across repositories and package dependencies

| [Popover](/code-navigation/features#popover)                           | Quickly view a symbol's type signature and documentation without switching to another source file                                                              |
| [Go to definition](/code-navigation/features#go-to-definition)         | Click the button or symbol name, navigates you to the symbol's definition                                                                                      |
| [Find references](/code-navigation/features#find-references)           | Selecting it in the popover lists all references, definitions, and implementations at the bottom, including precise and search-based results                   |
| [Find implementations](/code-navigation/features#find-implementations) | Click to go to a symbol's interface definition or, at the interface, see all implementations across repositories, including interfaces implemented by a struct |
| [Perform an action](/code-navigation/features#perform-an-action)                    | When browsing code, you can perform a couple of actions like open in code host, raw download and view blame.                                                   |

## Code Navigation types

There are two types of Code Navigation that Sourcegraph supports:

-   [Search-based Code Navigation](/code-navigation/search-based-code-navigation): Works out of the box with most popular programming languages, powered by Sourcegraph's code search. It uses a mix of text search and syntax-level heuristics (no language-level semantic information) for fast, performant searches across large code bases.
-   [Precise Code Navigation](/code-navigation/precise-code-navigation): Uses compile-time information to provide users with accurate cross-repository navigation experience across the entire code base.
