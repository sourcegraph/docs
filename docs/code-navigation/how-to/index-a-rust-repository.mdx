# Index a Rust repository

<p className="subtitle">
	This page describes how you can use [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) and [src-cli](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli) to enable precise indexing for Rust codebases.
</p>

<Callout type="note">
	Unlike other SCIP indexers, Rust uses rust-analyzer (the Rust language server) which has built-in SCIP generation support. No separate indexer package is needed.
</Callout>

## CI/CD Integrations and Local Indexing

For integration with CI/CD systems, or to test precise indexing of an individual repository, the following instructions can be used
to install and run `rust-analyzer` and `src-cli`.

<Callout type="info">
	For general CI patterns (sub-projects, custom build environments, and upload frequency), see [Adding precise code navigation to CI/CD workflows](/code-navigation/how-to/adding-scip-to-workflows).
</Callout>

### Setup

1. Install [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) via rustup:

```shell
rustup component add rust-analyzer
```

Alternatively, download a pre-built binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/releases).

2. Install the [Sourcegraph CLI](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli):

```shell
 curl -L https://sourcegraph.com/.api/src-cli/src_linux_amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/src
 chmod +x /usr/local/bin/src
```

-   **macOS**: Replace `linux` with `darwin` in the URL and choose the appropriate architecture: M1/M2 chips - `arm64`, Intel chips - `amd64`.
-   **Windows**: Visit [the CLI repo](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli) for further instructions.

### Indexing

1. `cd` into your Rust project's root (where the `Cargo.toml` file lives) and run:

```shell
 rust-analyzer scip .
```

This generates a file named `index.scip` by default. You can customize the output path with `--output`:

```shell
 rust-analyzer scip . --output path/to/output.scip
```

<Callout type="note">
	The project must be a valid Cargo project with a `Cargo.toml` file. Use `--exclude-vendored-libraries` to skip indexing vendored code.
</Callout>

2. Upload the data to a Sourcegraph instance with:

```shell
export SRC_ENDPOINT="YOUR_SOURCEGRAPH_URL"
export SRC_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_SOURCEGRAPH_API_TOKEN"

cd path/to/index.scip
src code-intel upload
```

The upload command will provide a URL you can visit to see the upload status.
