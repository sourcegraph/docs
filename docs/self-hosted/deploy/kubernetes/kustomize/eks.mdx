# Installation Guide - Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

This section is aimed at providing high-level guidance on deploying Sourcegraph using a Kustomize overlay on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

<Callout type="note">
	For security, please follow [Amazon best
	practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/best-practices-root-user.html)
	and _do not deploy Sourcegraph using your AWS account root user._
</Callout>

## Overview

The installation instructions below will guide you through deploying Sourcegraph on Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) with our quick-start overlay.

The overlay will:

-   Deploy a Sourcegraph instance without RBAC resources
-   Configure Ingress to use [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html) to expose Sourcegraph publicly on your domain
-   Configure the Storage Class to use [AWS EBS CSI driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-ebs-csi.html) (installed as adds-on)

## IAM permissions

To deploy Sourcegraph on Amazon EKS using Kustomize, you will need an IAM user or role with the following permissions. Following the [principle of least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege), only grant the minimum permissions required for deployment and operation.

### Required IAM policy for deployment

This guide assumes you already have an EKS cluster. If you need to create the cluster, see the [EKS deployment guide](/self-hosted/deploy/kubernetes/eks#iam-permissions) for cluster creation permissions.

For deploying Sourcegraph to an existing EKS cluster, the IAM user or role needs:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "EKSClusterAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [

        "eks:ListClusters",
        "eks:AccessKubernetesApi"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {

        "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeListeners",
        "elasticloadbalancing:DeleteListener",
        "elasticloadbalancing:ModifyLoadBalancerAttributes",
        "elasticloadbalancing:ModifyTargetGroupAttributes",
        "elasticloadbalancing:AddTags",
        "elasticloadbalancing:RemoveTags"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "SecurityGroupManagement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
        "ec2:CreateSecurityGroup",
        "ec2:DeleteSecurityGroup",
        "ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress",
        "ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupIngress",
        "ec2:DescribeVpcs",
        "ec2:DescribeSubnets"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Purpose of each permission set:**

- **EKSClusterAccess**: Allows interaction with the existing EKS cluster to deploy and manage Kubernetes resources. Required to authenticate kubectl commands and access the Kubernetes API.

- **EBSVolumeManagement**: Enables the EBS CSI driver to dynamically provision and manage persistent volumes for Sourcegraph pods, storing application data, databases, and search indices. Required for StatefulSets and PersistentVolumeClaims.

- **LoadBalancerManagement**: Permits the AWS Load Balancer Controller to automatically create and manage Application Load Balancers based on Kubernetes ingress resources, providing HTTPS/TLS termination and external access to Sourcegraph.

- **SecurityGroupManagement**: Allows the AWS Load Balancer Controller to manage security groups for load balancers, controlling network traffic to ensure secure access to the Sourcegraph deployment.

### IAM roles for Kubernetes service accounts

The AWS Load Balancer Controller and EBS CSI driver require [IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) to access AWS APIs. These roles should be configured when setting up the addons:

- **AWS Load Balancer Controller IAM Role**: Requires permissions to manage Application Load Balancers and Target Groups
- **EBS CSI Driver IAM Role**: Requires permissions to manage EBS volumes

For detailed instructions on creating these IAM roles, see:
- [AWS Load Balancer Controller IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html)
- [EBS CSI driver IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/csi-iam-role.html)

### IAM roles for Sourcegraph workloads (recommended)

For production deployments, use IRSA to grant Sourcegraph pods access to AWS services:

- [External S3 storage](/self-hosted/external-services/object-storage) for code intelligence uploads
- [AWS RDS for PostgreSQL](/self-hosted/external-services/postgres#usage-with-aws-rds-iam-auth) with IAM authentication

Create specific IAM roles with only the permissions needed for each service account, scoped to the specific AWS resources (S3 buckets, RDS databases) that Sourcegraph will access.

## Network Configuration and Data Encryption

For detailed network and encryption configuration for your EKS deployment, see:

- [Network Configuration](/self-hosted/deploy/kubernetes/eks#network-configuration) - EKS-specific VPC, subnet, and security group guidance
- [Data Encryption](/self-hosted/deploy/kubernetes/eks#data-encryption) - EKS secrets encryption and EBS encryption for persistent volumes

These guides cover the essential security configurations for production EKS deployments, including Kubernetes secrets encryption and encrypted StorageClass definitions.

---

## Prerequisites

-   A EKS cluster (>=1.19) with the following addons enabled:
    -   [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html)
    -   [AWS EBS CSI driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-ebs-csi.html)
-   Minimum Kubernetes version: [v1.19](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/08/26/kubernetes-release-1.19-accentuate-the-paw-sitive/) with [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) v1.19 or later
-   [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) (built into `kubectl` in version >= 1.14)

## Quick Start

You must complete **all** the prerequisites listed above before installing Sourcegraph with following steps.

### Step 1: Deploy Sourcegraph

Deploy Sourcegraph main app without the monitoring stacks to your cluster:

```bash
$ kubectl apply --prune -l deploy=sourcegraph -k https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-k8s/examples/aws
```

Monitor the deployment status to make sure everything is up and running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n ns-sourcegraph -o wide --watch
```

### Step 2: Access Sourcegraph in Browser

To check the status of the load balancer and obtain its IP:

```bash
$ kubectl describe ingress sourcegraph-frontend -n ns-sourcegraph
```

From you output, look for the IP address of the load balancer, which is listed under `Address`.

```bash
# Sample output:
Name:             sourcegraph-frontend
Namespace:        default
Address:          12.345.678.0
```

Once the load balancer is ready, you can access your new Sourcegraph instance at the returned IP address in your browser via HTTP. Accessing the IP address with HTTPS will return errors because TLS must be enabled first.

It might take about 10 minutes for the load balancer to be fully ready. In the meantime, you can access Sourcegraph using the port forward method as described below.

#### Port forward

Forward the remote port so that you can access Sourcegraph without network configuration temporarily.

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/sourcegraph-frontend 3080:30080 -n ns-sourcegraph
```

You should now be able to access your new Sourcegraph instance at http://localhost:3080 🎉

### Further configuration

The steps above have guided you to deploy Sourcegraph using the [quick-start/aws/eks](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-k8s/tree/master/examples/aws) overlay preconfigured by us.

If you would like to make other configurations to your existing instance, you can create a new overlay using its kustomization.yaml file shown below and build on top of it. For example, you can upgrade your instance from size XS to L, or add the monitoring stacks.

```yaml
# overlays/$INSTANCE_NAME/kustomization.yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
namespace: ns-sourcegraph
resources:
    # Deploy Sourcegraph main stack
    - ../../base/sourcegraph
    # Deploy Sourcegraph monitoring stack
    - ../../base/monitoring
components:
    # Use resources for a size-XS instance
    - ../../components/sizes/xs
    # Apply configurations for AWS EKS storage class and ALB
    - ../../components/clusters/aws/eks-ebs
```

#### Enable TLS

Once you have created a new overlay using the kustomization file from our quick-start overlay for AWS EKS, we strongly recommend that you:

-   create a DNS A record for your Sourcegraph instance domain
-   enable TLS is highly recommended.

If you would like to enable TLS with your own certificate, please read the [TLS configuration guide](/self-hosted/deploy/kubernetes/configure#tls) for detailed instructions.

##### AWS-managed certificate

In order to use a managed certificate from [AWS Certificate Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html) to enable TLS:

Step 1: Add the `aws/mange-cert` component to your overlay:

```yaml
# instances/$INSTANCE_NAME/buildConfig.yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
namespace: ns-sourcegraph
resources:
    - ../../base/sourcegraph
    - ../../base/monitoring
components:
    - ../../components/resources/namespace
    - ../../components/sizes/xs
    - ../../components/clusters/aws/eks-ebs
    - ../../components/clusters/aws/managed-cert
```

Step 2: Set the `AWS_MANAGED_CERT_ARN` variable with the `ARN of your AWS-managed TLS certificate` under the [BUILD CONFIGURATIONS](/self-hosted/deploy/kubernetes/kustomize/#buildconfig-yaml) section:

```yaml
# instances/$INSTANCE_NAME/buildConfig.yaml
kind: SourcegraphBuildConfig
metadata:
    name: sourcegraph-kustomize-config
data:
    # ARN of the AWS-managed TLS certificate
    AWS_MANAGED_CERT_ARN: arn:aws:acm:us-west-2:xxxxx:certificate/xxxxxxx
```
