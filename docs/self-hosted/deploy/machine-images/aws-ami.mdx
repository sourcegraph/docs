# Sourcegraph AWS AMI instances

Sourcegraph [Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instances-and-amis.html) allow you to quickly deploy a production-ready Sourcegraph instance tuned to your organization's scale in just a few clicks.

Following these docs will provision the following resources:

- An EC2 node running Sourcegraph
- A root EBS volume with 50GB of storage
- An additional EBS volume with 500GB of storage for storing code and search indices

### Sourcegraph AMI account ID

All Sourcegraph AMIs are published from one of the following AWS accounts:

- Account ID: `840044800169`
- Account ID: `870751268155`

### Instance sizing

Refer to our [AWS Instance Sizing](/how-to/aws-instance-sizing) guide to determine the appropriate EC2 instance type for your Sourcegraph deployment based on the number of users and repositories.

Click [here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy#amazon-ec2-amis) to see the completed list of AMI IDs published in each region.

**The default AMI username is `ec2-user`.**

<Callout type="note">
	For security, please follow [Amazon best
	practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/best-practices-root-user.html)
	and _do not deploy Sourcegraph using your AWS account root user._
</Callout>

## IAM permissions

To deploy Sourcegraph using AWS AMIs, you will need an IAM user or role with the following permissions. Following the [principle of least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege), only grant the minimum permissions required for deployment and operation.

### Required IAM policy for deployment

The IAM user or role performing the deployment needs the following permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "EC2InstanceManagement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:RunInstances",
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus",
        "ec2:DescribeInstanceAttribute",
        "ec2:TerminateInstances",
        "ec2:StartInstances",
        "ec2:StopInstances",
        "ec2:RebootInstances",
        "ec2:DescribeImages",
        "ec2:DescribeImageAttribute"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "EC2NetworkManagement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
        "ec2:CreateSecurityGroup",
        "ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress",
        "ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress",
        "ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupIngress",
        "ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupEgress",
        "ec2:DescribeVpcs",
        "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
        "ec2:DescribeRouteTables"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "EBSVolumeManagement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:CreateVolume",
        "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
        "ec2:AttachVolume",
        "ec2:DetachVolume",
        "ec2:ModifyVolume",
        "ec2:CreateSnapshot",
        "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
        "ec2:DeleteSnapshot",
        "ec2:CreateTags"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "KeyPairManagement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeKeyPairs",
        "ec2:CreateKeyPair",
        "ec2:DeleteKeyPair"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "MarketplaceSubscription",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "aws-marketplace:ViewSubscriptions",
        "aws-marketplace:Subscribe"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Purpose of each permission set:**

- **EC2InstanceManagement**: Allows you to launch and manage EC2 instances from Sourcegraph AMIs. The image description permissions enable verification of the AMI details before deployment.

- **EC2NetworkManagement**: Enables creation and configuration of security groups (firewall rules) that control network access to your Sourcegraph instance, protecting it from unauthorized access.

- **EBSVolumeManagement**: Provides the ability to create and manage EBS volumes for persistent storage of Sourcegraph data (code repositories, search indices, database files). Snapshot permissions enable backup capabilities for disaster recovery.

- **KeyPairManagement**: Allows management of SSH key pairs for secure remote access to your EC2 instance for troubleshooting and maintenance.

- **MarketplaceSubscription**: Enables subscribing to and viewing Sourcegraph AMIs from the AWS Marketplace, required when launching instances from Marketplace-published AMIs.

### Optional permissions for advanced features

If you plan to configure HTTPS/TLS using AWS Load Balancer and Certificate Manager (see [Networking](#networking) section), add these permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "LoadBalancerManagement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "elasticloadbalancing:CreateLoadBalancer",
        "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers",
        "elasticloadbalancing:DeleteLoadBalancer",
        "elasticloadbalancing:CreateTargetGroup",
        "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTargetGroups",
        "elasticloadbalancing:RegisterTargets",
        "elasticloadbalancing:CreateListener",
        "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeListeners",
        "elasticloadbalancing:ModifyLoadBalancerAttributes",
        "elasticloadbalancing:ModifyTargetGroup"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "CertificateManagement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "acm:RequestCertificate",
        "acm:DescribeCertificate",
        "acm:ListCertificates"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Purpose of each permission set:**

- **LoadBalancerManagement**: Enables creation and management of Application Load Balancers for HTTPS/TLS termination, providing secure encrypted connections to Sourcegraph and distributing traffic for high availability.

- **CertificateManagement**: Allows requesting and managing SSL/TLS certificates through AWS Certificate Manager for securing your Sourcegraph instance with HTTPS, eliminating the need to manually manage certificates.

### IAM role for the EC2 instance (recommended)

Instead of using static AWS credentials, create an [IAM role for EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html) and attach it to your Sourcegraph instance during launch. This is recommended when using:

- [External S3 storage](/self-hosted/external-services/object-storage) for code intelligence uploads
- [AWS RDS for PostgreSQL](/self-hosted/external-services/postgres#usage-with-aws-rds-iam-auth) with IAM authentication

The EC2 instance role should only include permissions for the specific AWS services that Sourcegraph will access (e.g., S3 buckets, RDS databases).

## Deploy Sourcegraph

![AWS Marketplace Sourcegraph](/aws-ami-marketplace.png)

1. Search for Sourcegraph in the AWS Marketplace or AMI catalog (see screenshot in the introduction).
2. Choose **Launch instance from AMI**.
3. Name your instance.
4. Select an **instance type** according to [our sizing guide](/how-to/aws-instance-sizing) or your specific requirements.
5. **Key pair (login)**: Select or create a new Key Pair for connecting to your instance securely (this may be required in the event you need support).
6. **Network settings**:
    - Under "Auto-assign public IP" select "Enable".
    - Select a **Security Group** for the instance, or create one with the following rules:
        - Allow SSH from Anywhere: `port range 22, source 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0`
        - Allow HTTPS from the internet: `port range 443, source 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0`
        - Allow HTTP traffic from the internet: `port range 80, source 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0`
    - **NOTE**: If you do not wish to have HTTP/HTTPS exposed to the public internet, you may later choose to remove these rules so that all traffic routes through your AWS load balancer.
7. **Configure storage**:
    - **Root Volume:** `50GB`
    - **EBS Volume:** `500GB` - this should be at least 25-50% _more_ than the size of all your repositories on disk (you may check your GitHub/BitBucket/GitLab instance's disk usage.)
8. Click **Launch instance**, and navigate to the public IP address in your browser. (Look for the IPv4 Public IP value in your EC2
   instance page under the Description panel.)

Once the instance has started, please allow ~5 minutes for Sourcegraph to initialize. During this time you may observe a `404 page not found` response.

To configure SSL, and lock down the instance from the public internet, see the [networking](#networking) section.

<Callout type="note">
	If you cannot access the Sourcegraph homepage after 10 minutes, please try
	reboot your instance.
</Callout>

### Executors

Executors are supported using [native kubernetes executors](/self-hosted/executors/deploy-executors-kubernetes).

Executors support [auto-indexing](/code-navigation/auto-indexing) and [server-side batch changes](/batch-changes/server-side).

To enable executors you must do the following:

1. Connect to the AMI instance using `ssh`
2. Run `cd /home/ec2-user/deploy/install/`
3. Replace the placeholder `executor.frontendPassword` in `override.yaml`
4. Run the following command to update the executor

```
helm upgrade -i -f ./override.yaml --version "$(cat /home/ec2-user/.sourcegraph-version)" executor ./sourcegraph-executor-k8s-charts.tgz
```

1. Add the following to the site-admin config using the password you chose previously

```
"executors.accessToken": "<exector.frontendPassword>",
"executors.frontendURL": "http://sourcegraph-frontend:30080",
"codeIntelAutoIndexing.enabled": true
```

1. Check `Site-Admin > Executors > Instances` to verify the executor connected successfully. If it does not appear try reboot the instance

To use server-side batch changes, see the [server-side batch changes documentation](/batch-changes/server-side).

## Networking

We suggest using an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) to manage HTTPS connections to Sourcegraph. This makes managing SSL certificates easy.

### Creating an AWS Load Balancer

<Callout type="warning">
	You must own a domain name before you can proceed with the following steps.
</Callout>

1. Request a certificate for the domain name in [AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/).
2. Create a [target group](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2#TargetGroups) for `HTTPS Port 443` that links to the instance's `Port 443`.
3. Create a new subnet inside the instance VPC.
4. Create a new Application Load Balancer via [AWS Load Balancers](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2#LoadBalancers).

#### Step 1: Request certificate

![AWS Certificate Manager request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68532117/192369850-e90d1078-7ad6-4624-acc1-db093ef4d642.png)

Open the [AWS Certificate Manager console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm) to **Request a certificate**:

- **Domain names**: Fully qualified domain name: your domain
- **Select validation method**: DNS validation—recommended

After the certificate has been created, you will need to attach the `CNAME name` and `CNAME values` to your DNS.

Follow the steps below to attach the CNAME to your DNS if your DNS is hosted in [AWS route 53](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53):

1. Click **Create record in route 53** in the certificate dashboard.
2. Select the DNS you would like to attach the certificate to.
3. Click **Create records** once you have verified the information is correct.
4. Wait ~30 minutes before the validation is completed.

#### Step 2: Create a target group

1. Click **Create a target group** on your [EC2 Target groups dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2#TargetGroups)
    - Choose a target type: `Instance`
    - Target group name: `YOUR-TARGETGROUP-NAME`
    - Protocol: `HTTPS`
    - Port: `443`
    - VPC: Select the VPC where your instance is located.
    - Protocol version: `HTTP2`
    - Health checks: `Use Default`
2. Click **Include as pending below**

#### Step 3: Create subnets

Click **Create subnet** in your VPC subnets dashboard:

- **VPC ID**: Selected the VPC that the instance is in.
- **Subnet name**: name the subnet.
- **Availability Zone**: select an availability zone that is different from the current zone.
- Click **Create subnet**

#### Step 4: Create an Application Load Balancer

1. Open your [EC2 Load Balancers dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2#LoadBalancers) to **Create Load Balancer**.
2. Choose **Application Load Balancer** as the Load balancer types using the following configurations:

- **Basic configuration**
    - Load balancer name: `YOUR-LOAD-BALANCER-NAME`
    - Scheme: `Internet-facing`
    - IP address type: `IPv4`
- **Network mapping**
    - VPC: Selected the VPC that the instance is in.
    - Mapping: Select two subnets associated with the selected VPC.
- **Security groups**
    - Security groups: Make sure only the security group associated with the instance is selected.
- **Listeners and routing**
    - Protocol: `HTTPS`
    - Port: `443`
    - Default action: Select the HTTPS target group created for the instance.

### Securing your instance

[Configure user authentication](/admin/auth) (SSO, SAML, OpenID Connect, etc.) to give users of your Sourcegraph instance access to it.

Now that your instance is confirmed to be working, and you have HTTPS working through an Amazon load balancer, you may choose to secure your Sourcegraph instance further by modifying the security group/firewall rules to prevent access from the public internet. You can do this by modifying the security group/firewall rules.
