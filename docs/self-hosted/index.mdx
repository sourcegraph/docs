This section of the documentation is meant for Sourcegraph enterprise self-hosted users.

Sourcegraph administration is primarily managed by site administrators, who are responsible for the deployment, management, and configuration of Sourcegraph instances for end users. For a comprehensive introduction to site administration, refer to our [quickstart guide](/admin/how-to/site-admin-quickstart).
