# Using a managed object storage service (S3 or GCS)

By default, Sourcegraph will use a `sourcegraph/blobstore` server bundled with the instance to temporarily store [code graph indexes](../../code-navigation/precise_code_navigation) uploaded by users as well as the results of [search jobs](../../code-search/types/search-jobs).

You can alternatively configure your instance to instead store this data in an S3 or GCS bucket. Doing so may decrease your hosting costs as persistent volumes are often more expensive than the same storage space in an object store service.

## Code Graph Indexes

To target a managed object storage service for storing [code graph index uploads](../../code-navigation/precise_code_navigation), you will need to set a handful of environment variables for configuration and authentication to the target service.

-   If you are running a `sourcegraph/server` deployment, set the environment variables on the server container
-   If you are running via Docker-compose or Kubernetes, set the environment variables on the `frontend`, `worker`, and `precise-code-intel-worker` containers

### Using S3

To target an S3 bucket you've already provisioned, set the following environment variables. Authentication can be done through [an access and secret key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys) (and optional session token), or via the EC2 metadata API.

-   `PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_ENDPOINT=https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
-   `PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your access key>`
-   `PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your secret key>`
-   `PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<your session token>` (optional)
-   `PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_USE_EC2_ROLE_CREDENTIALS=true` (optional; set to use EC2 metadata API over static credentials)
-   `PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_REGION=us-east-1` (default)

	to the EC2 instances hosting the `frontend`, `worker`, and `precise-code-intel-worker`
	containers in a multi-node environment.{' '}
</Callout>

### Using GCS

To target a GCS bucket you've already provisioned, set the following environment variables. Authentication is done through a service account key, supplied as either a path to a volume-mounted file, or the contents read in as an environment variable payload.

-   `PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_BACKEND=GCS`
-   `PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_BUCKET=<my bucket name>`
-   `PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_GCP_PROJECT_ID=<my project id>`
-   `PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_FILE=</path/to/file>`
-   `PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_FILE_CONTENT=<{"my": "content"}>`

### Provisioning buckets

If you would like to allow your Sourcegraph instance to control the creation and lifecycle configuration management of the target buckets, set the following environment variables:

-   `PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_MANAGE_BUCKET=true`
-   `PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_TTL=168h` (default)

## Search Job Results

To target a third party managed object storage service for storing [search job results](../../code-search/types/search-jobs), you must set a handful of environment variables for configuration and authentication to the target service.

-   If you are running a `sourcegraph/server` deployment, set the environment variables on the server container
-   If you are running via Docker-compose or Kubernetes, set the environment variables on the `frontend` and `worker` containers

### Using S3

Set the following environment variables to target an S3 bucket you've already provisioned. Authentication can be done through [an access and secret key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys) (and optionally through session token) or via the EC2 metadata API.

### Using GCS

-   `SEARCH_JOBS_UPLOAD_GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_FILE_CONTENT=<{"my": "content"}>`

### Provisioning buckets

If you would like to allow your Sourcegraph instance to control the creation and lifecycle configuration management of the target buckets, set the following environment variables:

-   `SEARCH_JOBS_UPLOAD_MANAGE_BUCKET=true`
