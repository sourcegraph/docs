## Unreleased

## v5.9.0 ➔ v5.10.1164

-   This release resolves an issue in the v5.10.0 release which prevented multiversion upgrades from working. You may now target `v5.10.1164` using migrator's `upgrade` command. Or use autoupgrade by setting the environment variable `SRC_AUTOUPGRADE_IGNORE_DRIFT=true` on the sourcegraph container.

## v5.9.0 -> v5.10.0

#### Notes:

> Warning: Admins are advised to upgrade directly to v5.10.1164 circumventing this release.
>
> Warning: **In 5.10 the Sourcegraph database images are being updated from postgres 12 to postgres 16 to avoid postgres 12's end of life. This update will not yet be applied to Sourcegraph server's all in one database.**
>
> Warning: `automatic` and migrator `upgrade` command will not work for this release, please upgrade directly to `v5.10.1164`, or to a 5.9 version and conduct a standard upgrade using migrator's default `up` command!

**What does this mean for admins?**

-   During the postgres version upgrade `pg_upgrade` automatically makes some changes to the database schema.
-   The new canonical database schema is now based on postgres 16, the drift detection tool will report drift between the old and new database schema. This is expected and is a result of the postgres upgrade.
-   Admins should not run migrators suggested drift fixes until the database is upgraded.

## v5.0.6 ➔ v5.1.0

#### Notes:

-   The Docker Single Container Deployment image has switched to a Wolfi-based container image. Upon upgrading, Sourcegraph will need to re-index the entire database.

## v4.4.2 ➔ v4.5.0

#### Notes:

-   This release introduces a background job that will convert all LSIF data into SCIP. **This migration is irreversible** and a rollback from this version may result in loss of precise code intelligence data. Please see the [migration notes](/admin/how-to/lsif_scip_migration) for more details.

## v3.34 ➔ v3.35

#### Notes:

-   There is a [known issue](/code_insights/how-tos/Troubleshooting#oob-migration-has-made-progress-but-is-stuck-before-reaching-100) with the Code Insights out-of-band settings migration not reaching 100% complete when encountering deleted users or organizations.

## v3.30 ➔ v3.31

> WARNING: **This upgrade must originate from `v3.30.3`.**

#### Notes:

-   The **built-in** main Postgres (`pgsql`) and codeintel (`codeintel-db`) databases have switched to an alpine-based Docker image. Upon upgrading, Sourcegraph will need to re-index the entire database.

## v3.29 ➔ v3.30

> WARNING: **If you have already upgraded to 3.30.0, 3.30.1, or 3.30.2** please see the rebuild corrupt postgres indexes guide for recovery steps.

## v3.26 ➔ v3.27

> WARNING: Sourcegraph 3.27 now requires **Postgres 12+**.

#### Notes:

-   If you are using an external database, [upgrade your database](/self-hosted/postgres#upgrading-external-postgresql-instances) to Postgres 12 or above prior to upgrading Sourcegraph. If you are using the embedded database, [prepare your data for migration](/self-hosted/postgres#upgrading-single-node-docker-deployments) prior to upgrading Sourcegraph.

## v3.24 ➔ v3.25

#### Notes:

-   Go `1.15` introduced changes to SSL/TLS connection validation which requires certificates to include a `SAN`. This field was not included in older certificates and clients relied on the `CN` field. You might see an error like `x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field`. We recommend that customers using Sourcegraph with an external database and and connecting to it using SSL/TLS check whether the certificate is up to date.
    -   AWS RDS customers please reference [AWS' documentation on updating the SSL/TLS certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html) for steps to rotate your certificate.

## v3.21 ➔ v3.22

> WARNING: **This upgrade must originate from `v3.20.1`.**

No upgrade notes.

## v3.20 ➔ v3.21

> WARNING: **This upgrade must originate from `v3.17.2`** due to a patched bug in our release.

#### Notes:

-   This release introduces a second database instance, `codeintel-db`. If you have configured Sourcegraph with an external database, then update the `CODEINTEL_PG*` environment variables to point to a new external database as described in the [external database documentation](/self-hosted/external_services/postgres). Again, these must not point to the same database or the Sourcegraph instance will refuse to start.
-   **Turn off database secrets encryption**. In Sourcegraph version 3.20, we would automatically generate a secret key file (`/var/lib/sourcegraph/token`) inside the container for encrypting secrets stored in the database. However, it is not yet ready for general use and format of the secret key file might change. Therefore, it is best to delete the secret key file (`/var/lib/sourcegraph/token`) and turn off the database secrets encryption.
