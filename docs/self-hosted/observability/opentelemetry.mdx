# OpenTelemetry

> This page is a deep dive into OpenTelemetry and customizing it. To get started with HTTP Tracing, see the [Tracing](/self-hosted/observability/tracing) page.

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) (OTEL) is an industry-standard toolset to handle observability data, ex. metrics, logs, and traces.

To handle this data, Sourcegraph deployments include a bundled [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) (otel-collector) container, which can be configured to ingest, process, and export observability data to a backend of your choice. This approach offers great flexibility.

> NOTE: Sourcegraph currently uses OTEL for tracing, and may use it for metrics and logs in the future.

For an in-depth explanation of the parts that compose a full collector pipeline, see OpenTelemetry's [documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/).

## Deployment and Configuration

Sourcegraph's bundled otel-collector is deployed via Docker image, and is configured via configuration YAML file. By default, it is not configured to do anything with the data it receives, but [exporters](#exporters) to various backends can be configured.

For details on how to deploy the otel-collector, and where to find its configuration file, refer to the docs page specific to your deployment type:

- [Kubernetes with Helm](/self-hosted/deploy/kubernetes#configure-opentelemetry-collector-to-use-an-external-tracing-backend)
- [Kubernetes with Kustomize](/self-hosted/deploy/kubernetes/configure#deploy-opentelemetry-collector-to-use-an-external-tracing-backend)
- [Docker Compose](/self-hosted/deploy/docker-compose/configuration#configure-an-external-tracing-backend)

## HTTP Tracing Backends

Sourcegraph containers export traces in OTEL format to the bundled otel-collector.
For more information about traces, see the [Tracing](/self-hosted/observability/tracing) page.

The bundled otel-collector includes the following exporters, which support traces in OTEL format:

- [OTLP-compatible backends](#otlp-compatible-backends), ex. Honeycomb, Grafana Tempo
- [Jaeger](#jaeger)
- [Google Cloud](#google-cloud)

Basic configuration for each tracing backend type is described below.

> NOTE: If you require an additional exporter from the [opentelemetry-collector-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter) repository, please contact Sourcegraph Customer Support.

To enable a backend, it must be adding to both the `exporters` block and the `service` block:

```yaml
receivers:
    otlp:
        protocols:
            grpc:
            http:

exporters:
    logging: # Export traces as log events
        loglevel: warn
        sampling_initial: 5
        sampling_thereafter: 200

service:
    pipelines:
        traces:
            receivers:
                - otlp
            exporters:
                - logging # The exporter name must be added here to enable it
```

## Sampling traces

To reduce the volume of traces exported, the collector can be configured to apply sampling. Sourcegraph includes the [probabilistic](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/probabilisticsamplerprocessor) and [tail](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/tailsamplingprocessor/README.md) samplers in the bundled collector.

> NOTE: If sampling is enabled, the sampling mechanism will be applied to all traces, regardless if a request was explicitly requested to be traced.

### Probabilistic sampler

The probabilistic sampler hashes TraceIDs and determines whether a trace should be sampled based on this hash. Note that semantic convention of tags on a trace take precedence over TraceID hashing when deciding whether a trace should be sampled or not.

To enable probabilistic sampling, add the following to the `processors` block:

```yaml
exporters:
    # ...

processors:
    probabilistic_sampler:
        hash_seed: 22 # An integer used to compute the hash algorithm. Note that all collectors for a given tier (e.g. behind the same load balancer) should have the same hash_seed.
        sampling_percentage: 10.0 # (default = 0): Percentage at which traces are sampled; >= 100 samples all traces

service:
    pipelines:
        # ...
        traces:
            #...
            processors: [probabilistic_sampler] # Plug the probabilistic sampler to the traces.
```

### Tail sampling

The tail sampler samples traces according to policies and the sampling decision of whether a trace should be sampled is determined at the _tail end_ of a pipeline. For more information on the supported policies and other configuration options of the sampler see [tail sampler configuration](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/tailsamplingprocessor/README.md).

The sampler waits for a certain amount of spans before making applying the configured policy. Due to it keeping a certain amount of spans in memory, the sampler incurs as slight performance cost compared to the probabilistic sampler.

To understand how the policies are applied, see the open-telemetry code [here](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib@71dd19d2e59cd1f8aa9844461089d5c17efaa0ca/-/blob/processor/tailsamplingprocessor/processor.go?L214).

To enable tail sampling, and customize the policies, add the following to the `processors` block:

```yaml
receivers:
    # ...
exporters:
    # ...
processors:
    tail_sampling:
        # Wait time since the first span of a trace before making a sampling decision
        decision_wait: 30s # default value = 30s
        # Number of traces kept in memory
        num_traces: 50000 # default value = 50000
        # Expected number of new traces (helps in allocating data structures)
        expected_new_traces_per_sec: 10 # default value = 0
        policies: [
                {
                    # If a span contains `sampling_retain: true`, it will always be included
                    name: policy-retain,
                    type: string_attribute,
                    string_attribute: {key: sampling.retain, values: ['true']}
                },
                {
                    # Only keep 10% of the traces.
                    name: policy-probabilistic,
                    type: probabilistic,
                    probabilistic: {sampling_percentage: 10}
                }
            ]

service:
    pipelines:
        traces:
            # ...
            processors: [tail_sampling]
```

## Filtering traces

The bundled otel-collector also includes the [filter processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/filterprocessor/README.md). The following example only allows traces with the service name "foobar". All other traces will be dropped.

```yaml
exporters:
    # ...
receivers:
    # ...
processors:
    filter/foobar: # Format is <processor type>/<name> - name is optional
        spans:
            include:
                match_type: strict # Also supports regex
                services:
                    - 'foobar'

service:
    pipelines:
        traces: # This pipeline exports all traces
        traces/foobar: # This pipeline only exports traces from the foobar service
            # ...
            processors: [filter/foobar]
```

## Exporters

Exporters send observability data from the otel-collector to the needed backend(s).
Each exporter can support one or more OTEL signals.

This section outlines some common exporter configurations. For details, see OpenTelemetry's [exporters](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/#exporters) page.

> NOTE: If you require an additional exporter from the [opentelemetry-collector-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter) repository, please contact Sourcegraph Customer Support.

### OTLP-compatible backends

Backends compatible with the [OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/) include services such as:

- [Honeycomb](https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/opentelemetry-overview/)
- [Grafana Tempo](https://grafana.com/blog/2021/04/13/how-to-send-traces-to-grafana-clouds-tempo-service-with-opentelemetry-collector/)

OTLP-compatible backends typically accept the [OTLP gRPC protocol](#otlp-grpc-backends), but may require the [OTLP HTTP protocol](#otlp-http-backends) instead.

#### OTLP gRPC backends

Refer to the [otlp exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/exporter/otlpexporter/README.md) documentation for available options.

```yaml
exporters:
    otlp:
        endpoint: secure-otel-collector:4317
        tls:
            cert_file: file.cert
            key_file: file.key
    otlp/2:
        endpoint: insecure-otel-collector:4317
        tls:
            insecure: true
```

#### OTLP HTTP backends

Refer to the [otlphttp exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/exporter/otlphttpexporter/README.md) documentation for available options.

```yaml
exporters:
    otlphttp:
        endpoint: https://example.com:4318/v1/traces
```

### Jaeger

If you're looking for information about Sourcegraph's bundled Jaeger instance, head back to the [Tracing](/self-hosted/observability/tracing) page to find the instructions for your deployment method.

Refer to the [Jaeger](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/js/exporters/#jaeger) documentation for options.

If you must use your own Jaeger instance, and if the bundled otel-collector's basic configuration with the Jaeger OTLP exporter enabled meets your needs, configure the otel-collector's startup command to `/usr/bin/otelcol-sourcegraph --config=/etc/otel-collector/configs/jaeger.yaml`. Note that this requires the environment variable `$JAEGER_HOST` to be set on the otel-collector service / container:

```yaml
# otel-collector config.yaml
exporters:
    otlp/jaeger:
        endpoint: '$JAEGER_HOST:4317'
        tls:
            insecure: true
```

The Sourcegraph frontend automatically proxies Jaeger's web UI to make it available at `/-/debug/jaeger`. You can proxy your own Jaeger instance instead by configuring the `JAEGER_SERVER_URL` environment variable on the `frontend` containers, and the `QUERY_BASE_PATH='/-/debug/jaeger'` environment variable on your `jaeger` container.

### Google Cloud

If you run Sourcegraph in GCP and wish to export your traces to Google Cloud Trace, otel-collector can use project authentication. See the [Google Cloud Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/exporter/googlecloudexporter/README.md) documentation for available options.

```yaml
exporters:
    googlecloud:
        # See docs
        project: project-name # Project name can also be fetched from secrets
        retry_on_failure:
            enabled: false
```
