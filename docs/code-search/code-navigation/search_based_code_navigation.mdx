# Search-based Code Navigation

<p className="subtitle">Learn and understand about Search-based Code Navigation.</p>

Sourcegraph comes with a default built-in code navigation provided by search-based heuristics. It works out of the box with all of the most popular programming languages.

## How does it work?

[Search-based Code Navigation](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-basic-code-intel) provides 3-core navigation features:

- **Jump to definition**: Performs a [symbol search](/code-search/features#symbol-search).
- **Hover documentation**: First, finds the definition. Then, extracts documentation from comments near the definition.
- **Find references**: Performs a case-sensitive word-boundary cross-repository [plain text search](/code-search/features#powerful-flexible-queries) for the given symbol

Search-based Code Navigation also filters results by file extension and by imports at the top of the file for some languages.

## What configuration settings can I apply?

The symbols container recognizes these environment variables:

|         **Env Vars**         |              **Deafult**              |                                            **Details**                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CTAGS_COMMAND`              | `universal-ctags`                     | Ctags command (should point to universal-ctags executable compiled with JSON and seccomp support) |
| `CTAGS_PATTERN_LENGTH_LIMIT` | `250`                                 | The maximum length of the patterns output by ctags                                                |
| `LOG_CTAGS_ERRORS`           | `false`                               | Log ctags errors                                                                                  |
| `SANITY_CHECK`               | `false`                               | Check that go-sqlite3 works then exit 0 if it's ok or 1 if not                                    |
| `SYMBOLS_CACHE_DIR`          | `/tmp/symbols-cache`                  | Directory in which to store cached symbols                                                        |
| `SYMBOLS_CACHE_SIZE_MB`      | `100000`                              | Maximum size of the disk cache (in megabytes)                                                     |
| `CTAGS_PROCESSES`            | `strconv.Itoa(runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0))` | Number of concurrent parser processes to run                                                      |
| `REQUEST_BUFFER_SIZE`        | `8192`                                | Maximum size of buffered parser request channel                                                   |
| `PROCESSING_TIMEOUT`         | `2 hrs`                               | Maximum time to spend processing a repository                                                     |
| `MAX_TOTAL_PATHS_LENGTH`     | `100000`                              | Maximum sum of lengths of all paths in a single call to git archive                               |
| `USE_ROCKSKIP`     | `false`                              | Enables [Rockskip](/code-search/code-navigation/rockskip) for fast symbol searches and search-based code navigation on repositories specified in `ROCKSKIP_REPOS`, or respositories over `ROCKSKIP_MIN_REPO_SIZE_MB` in size                               |
| `ROCKSKIP_REPOS`     | N/A                              | In combination with `USE_ROCKSKIP=true` this specifies a comma-separated list of repositories to index using [Rockskip](/code-search/code-navigation/rockskip)                              |
| `ROCKSKIP_MIN_REPO_SIZE_MB`     | N/A                              | In combination with `USE_ROCKSKIP=true` all repos that are at least this big will be indexed using Rockskip                              |
| `MAX_CONCURRENTLY_INDEXING`     | 4                              | Maximum number of repositories being indexed at a time by [Rockskip](/code-search/code-navigation/rockskip) (also limits ctags processes)                              |

The default values for these environment variables come from [`config.go`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-public-snapshot/blob/eea895ae1a8acef08370a5cc6f24bdc7c66cb4ed/cmd/symbols/config.go#L42-L59).
