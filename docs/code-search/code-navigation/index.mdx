# Code Navigation

<p className="subtitle">Learn how to navigate your code and understand its dependencies with high precision.</p>

Code Navigation helps you quickly understand your code, its dependencies, and symbols within the Sourcegraph file view while making it easier to move through your codebase via:

- Onboarding to codebases faster with cross-repository code navigation features like [Go to definition](/code-search/code-navigation/features#go-to-definition) and [Find references](/code-search/code-navigation/features#find-references)
- Providing complete precise reviews, getting up to speed on unfamiliar code, and determining the impact of code changes with the confidence of compiler-accurate code navigation
- Determining the root causes quickly with precise code navigation that tracks references across repositories and package dependencies

## Code Navigation types

There are two types of Code Navigation that Sourcegraph supports:

- [Search-based Code Navigation](/code_navigation/explanations/search_based_code_navigation): Works out of the box with most popular programming languages, powered by Sourcegraph's code search. It uses a mix of text search and syntax-level heuristics (no language-level semantic information) for fast, performant searches across large code bases.
- [Precise Code Navigation](/code_navigation/explanations/precise_code_navigation): Uses compile-time information to provide users with accurate cross-repository navigation experience across the entire code base.
