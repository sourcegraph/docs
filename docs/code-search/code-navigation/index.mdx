# Code Navigation

<p className="subtitle">Learn how to quickly navigate your code with high precision.</p>

Code Navigation helps you quickly understand your code, its dependencies, and symbols within the Sourcegraph file view while making it easier to move through your codebase via:

- Onboarding to codebases faster with cross-repository code navigation features like **Go to definition** and **Find references**
- Providing complete code reviews, getting up to speed on unfamiliar code, and determining the impact of code changes with the confidence of compiler-accurate code navigation
- Determining the root causes quickly with precise code navigation that tracks dependencies and references across repositories

| [Find implementations](/code_navigation/explanations/features#find-implementations)          | Click to go to a symbol's interface definition or, at the interface, see all implementations across repositories, including interfaces implemented by a struct                           |
| [Symbol search](/code_navigation/explanations/features#symbol-search)                        | Utilizes Ctags to on-demand index repository symbols, implementing search based on declarations rather than plain text                                                                         |

## Code Navigation types

There are two types of Code Navigation that Sourcegraph supports:

- [Search-based Code Navigation](/code_navigation/explanations/search_based_code_navigation): It is is available by default on all Sourcegraph instances and works out of the box with all of the most popular programming languages, powered by Sourcegraph's code search. Our default search-based code navigation uses syntactic-level heuristics (no language-level semantic information) for fast, performant searches across large code bases.
- [Precise Code Navigation](/code_navigation/explanations/precise_code_navigation): Uses compile-time information to provide users with an extremely precise and accurate cross-repository experience. This means you'll get an accurate view of all symbols and where they are used across your code base.
