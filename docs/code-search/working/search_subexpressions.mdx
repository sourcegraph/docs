# Search Subexpressions

<p className="subtitle">This page provides docs about using Search Subexpressions in Sourcegraph's Code Search.</p>

Search subexpressions combine groups of [filters](/code-search/queries#filters-all-searches) like `repo:` and
[operators](/code-search/queries#boolean-operators) like `or`. Compared to [basic examples](/code-search/queries/examples), search subexpressions allow more sophisticated queries.

Here are examples of how they can help you:

1. [Noncompliant spelling where case-sensitivity differs depending on the word](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+%28%28Github+case:yes%29+or+%28organisation+case:no%29%29&patternType=keyword).

```sgquery
 repo:sourcegraph ((Github case:yes) or (organisation case:no))
```

The about code finds places to change the spelling of `Github` to `GitHub` (case-sensitivity matters) or change the spelling of `organisation` to `organization` (case-sensitivity does not matter).

2. [Search for either a file name or file contents scoped to the same repository](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+-file:html+%28file:router+or+newRouter%29&patternType=keyword).

```sgquery
repo:sourcegraph -file:html (file:router or newRouter)
```

The above code finds both files containing the word `router` or file contents matching `newRouter` in the same repository, while excluding `html` files. Useful when exploring files or code that interact with a general term like `router`.

3. [Scope file content searches to particular files or repositories](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=+repo:sourcegraph+%28%28file:schema%5C.graphql+hover%28...%29%29+or+%28file:codeintel%5C.go+%28Line+or+Character%29%29%29&patternType=structural)

```sgquery
 repo:sourcegraph
 (
  (file:schema.graphql hover(...))
  or
  (file:codeintel.go (Line or Character))
 )
 patterntype:structural
```

Combine matches of `hover(...)` in the `schema.graphql` file and matches of `Line` or `Character` in the `codeintel.go` file in the same repository. Useful for crafting queries that precisely match related fragments of a codebase to
capture context and e.g., share with coworkers.

<Callout type="note">The query is formatted for readability, it is valid as a single line query.</Callout>

4. [Search across multiple repositories at multiple revisions](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=%28repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24%40v3.22.0:v3.22.1+or+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/src-cli%24%403.22.0:3.22.1%29+file:CHANGELOG+campaigns&patternType=keyword).

```sgquery
 (
   repo:^github\.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph$@v3.22.0:v3.22.1
   or
   repo:^github\.com/sourcegraph/src-cli$@3.22.0:3.22.1
 )
 file:CHANGELOG campaigns
```

Finds the word `campaigns` in `CHANGELOG` files for two repositories, `sourcegraph/sourcegraph  ` or `sourcegraph/src-cli`, at specific revisions. Useful for searching across a larger scope of repositories at particular revisions.

## General tips for crafting queries with subexpressions

### Fully parenthesize subexpressions

It's best practice to parenthesize
queries to avoid confusion. For example, there are multiple ways to group the
query, which is not fully parenthesized:

```sgquery
repo:sourcegraph (Github case:yes) or (organisation case:no)
```

It could mean either of these:

```sgquery
(repo:sourcegraph (Github case:yes)) or (organisation case:no)
```

```sgquery
repo:sourcegraph ((Github case:yes) or (organisation case:no))
```

When parentheses are absent, we use the convention that operators divide sequences of terms that should be grouped together. That is: `file:main.c char c or (int i and int j)` generally means `(file:main.c char c) or (int i and int
j)`.

This convention means we would pick the following meaning of the original query, but it may not be what you intended:

```sgquery
(repo:sourcegraph (Github case:yes)) or (organisation case:no)
```

Fully parenthesizing subexpressions makes it clear what the intent is, so that you can avoid relying on conventions that may not interpret the query the way you intended.

### Subexpression expansion

If you're unsure whether a subexpression is valid, it may be useful to think in terms of how a subexpression expands to multiple independent queries. Expansion relies on a distributive property over `or`-expressions. For example:

```sgquery
repo:sourcegraph ((Github case:yes) or (organisation case:no))
```

This is equivalent to expanding the query by putting `repo:sourcegraph` inside each subexpression:

```sgquery
(repo:sourcegraph Github case:yes) or (repo:sourcegraph organisation case:no)
```

This query is valid because each side of the `or` operator is a valid query. On the other hand, the following query is **invalid**:

```sgquery
repo:sourcegraph case:yes (Github or (case:no organisation))
```

Because after expanding it is equivalent to:

```sgquery
(repo:sourcegraph case:yes Github) or (repo:sourcegraph case:yes case:no organisation)
```

After expanding, the right-hand side contains both `case:yes` and `case:no`. Since this subpart of the query is invalid, the original query is also invalid.
