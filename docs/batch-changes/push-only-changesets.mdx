**Pushing code to a code host**

<p className="subtitle">Learn how to push code changes to a code host without making a merge request.</p>

<Callout type="note">Pushed-only changesets work on GitHub and GitLab only. They do not yet work with forked repositories.</Callout>


After you've [created a batch change](/batch-changes/create-a-batch-change), you will be redirected to a page displaying a list of the changesets the Batch Change created. From this page, you can apply any bulk operation to 1+ changesets. 


 To push code to a new branch on a code host without also creating a merge request, simply select 'push only' from the dropdown menu:

## Notes
- With pushed-only changesets, you are still able see CI feedback, as long as it triggers on code pushes.
- The `review` status of a pushed-only changeset is always "N/A." 
- The `status` of a pushed-only changeset is always "OPEN."
- To publish a pushed-only changeset, simply select the changeset in the Batch Changes UI and select 'Publish.'


## Requirements
To push code to a new branch on a code host, you will need:

- [Admin permissions for the batch change](/batch-changes/permissions-in-batch-changes#permission-levels-for-batch-changes)
- Write access to the changeset's repository on the code host
- A [personal access token](/batch-changes/configuring-credentials#personal-access-tokens) or a [global service account token](/batch-changes/configuring-credentials#global-service-account-tokens) configured for the code host
