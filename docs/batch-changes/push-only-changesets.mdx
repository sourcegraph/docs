# Pushing code to a code host

	Learn how to push code changes to a code host without making a merge

<Callout type="note">
	Pushed-only changesets work on GitHub and GitLab only. They do not yet work
	with forked repositories.

After you've [created a batch change](/batch-changes/create-a-batch-change), you will be redirected to a page displaying a list of the changesets the Batch Change created. From this page, you can apply any bulk operation to more than one changesets.

To push code to a new branch on a code host without also creating a merge request, simply select **Push to code host only** from the dropdown menu:

## Few important considerations

-   With pushed-only changesets, you are still able see CI feedback, as long as it triggers on code pushes
-   The `review` status of a pushed-only changeset is always "N/A"
-   The `status` of a pushed-only changeset is always "Open"
-   To publish a pushed-only changeset, simply select the changeset in the Batch Changes UI and select **Publish**

## Requirements

To push code to a new branch on a code host, you will need:

-   [Admin permissions for the batch change](/batch-changes/permissions-in-batch-changes#permission-levels-for-batch-changes)
-   Write access to the changeset's repository on the code host
-   [Credentials](/batch-changes/configuring-credentials) configured for the code host
