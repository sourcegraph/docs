# Batch Spec YAML Reference

<p className="subtitle">
	Sourcegraph Batch Changes use [batch
	specs](/batch-changes/create-a-batch-change#writing-a-batch-spec) to define
	batch changes. This page is a reference guide to the batch spec YAML format
	in which batch specs are defined.
</p>

## `version`

The `version` of the batch spec. Defaults to 1 if not specified. New batch specs should use version 2.
We recommend to always specify the version.

### Version 1

The schema version before Sourcegraph version 5.5.
For now, if no version is specified, batch changes will use this schema version.
It is recommended to switch to version 2.

### Version 2 (recommended)

Introduced in Sourcegraph version 5.5.
Queries defined under [`on.repositoriesMatchingQuery`](#onrepositoriesmatchingquery) default to keyword search instead of standard search.
Authors can override the default by specifying the pattern type explicitly.
Refer to the [search syntax docs](/code-search/queries) for more information about pattern types.

### Example

```yaml
version: 2
```

## `name`

The `name` of the batch change, which is unique among all batch changes in the namespace. A batch change's name is case-preserving.

### Examples

```yaml
name: update-go-import-statements
```

```yaml
name: update-node.js
```

## `description`

The `description` of the batch change. It's rendered as Markdown.

### Examples

```yaml
description: This batch change changes all `fmt.Sprintf` calls to `strconv.Iota`.
```

```yaml
description: |
    This batch change changes all imports from

    `gopkg.in/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-in-x86-asm`

    to

    `github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-in-x86-asm`
```

## `on`

The set of repositories (and branches) on which the batch change would run. It's specified as a list of search queries (that match repositories) and specific repositories.

### Examples

```yaml
on:
    - repositoriesMatchingQuery: lang:go fmt.Sprintf\("%d", \w+\) patterntype:regexp
    - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph
```

## `on.repositoriesMatchingQuery`

A Sourcegraph search query that matches a set of repositories (and branches). Each matched repository branch is added to the list of repositories on which the batch change will run.

Your search query should answer the question, "Where do I want to run this batch change?". Search result matches for things like commits, symbols, or file owners will be ignored.

It's good practice to explicitly specify the pattern type. If you don't specify a pattern type, the default is determined by the [batch spec version](#version).

<Callout type="tip">
	See [Code Search Queries](/code-search/queries/) docs for more information.
</Callout>

### Examples

```yaml
on:
    - repositoriesMatchingQuery: file:README -repo:github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli
```

```yaml
on:
    - repositoriesMatchingQuery: lang:typescript file:web \"const changesetStatsFragment\" patterntype:keyword
```

## `on.repository`

A specific repository (and, optionally, one or more branches) that's added to the list of repositories on which the batch change will run.

<Callout type="note">
	For Sourcegraph version 3.35 or less, if multiple branches are specified,
	then only the last-named branch will be used, and only a single `branch`
	could be provided. For Sourcegraph version 3.35 or more, all branches are
	used.
</Callout>

To match a branch other than the default, `branch` or `branches` can be used to specify one or multiple branches, respectively. Only one of `branch` or `branches` can be set.

<Callout type="warning">
	If multiple branches are matched for the same repository, then
	[`changesetTemplate.branch`](#changesettemplate-branch) will need to have a
	different value for each branch.
</Callout>

### Examples

```yaml
on:
    - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli
```

```yaml
on:
    - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph
      branch: 3.19-beta
    - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli
```

In the following example, the `repositoriesMatchingQuery` returns both repositories with their default branch, but the `3.23` branch is used for `github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph`, since it is more specific:

```yaml
on:
    - repositoriesMatchingQuery: repo:sourcegraph\/(sourcegraph|src-cli)$
    - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph
      branch: 3.23
```

In this example, both the `3.19-beta` and `3.23` branches are used:

```yaml
on:
    - repositoriesMatchingQuery: repo:sourcegraph\/(sourcegraph|src-cli)$
    - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph
      branches:
          - 3.19-beta
          - 3.23
```

## `steps`

The sequence of commands to run (for each repository branch matched in the `on` property) to produce the batch change.

### Examples

```yaml
steps:
    - run: echo "Hello World!">> README
      container: alpine:3
```

```yaml
steps:
    - run: comby -in-place 'fmt.Sprintf("%d", :[v])' 'strconv.Itoa(:[v])' .go -matcher .go -exclude-dir .,vendor
      container: comby/comby
    - run: gofmt -w ./
      container: golang:1.15-alpine
```

```yaml
steps:
    - run: ./update_dependency.sh
      container: our-custom-image
      env:
          OLD_VERSION: 1.31.7
          NEW_VERSION: 1.33.0
```

## `steps.run`

The shell command to run in the container. It can also be a multi-line shell script. The working directory is the root directory of the repository checkout.

<Callout type="note">
	`steps.run` can include [template
	variables](/batch-changes/batch-spec-templating).
</Callout>

## `steps.container`

The Docker image used to launch the Docker container in which the shell command is run. The image has to have either the `/bin/sh` or the `/bin/bash` shell.

It is executed using `docker` on the machine on which the [Sourcegraph CLI (`src`)](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli) is executed. If the image exists locally, that is used. Otherwise, it's pulled using `docker pull.`

## `steps.env`

Environment variables to set in the environment when running this command. These may be defined either as an [object](#environment-object) or as an [array](#environment-array).

<Callout type="note">
	`steps.env` can include [template
	variables](/batch-changes/batch-spec-templating).
</Callout>

### Environment object

In this case, `steps.env` is an object, where the key is the environment variable's name and the value is the value.

### Examples

```yaml
steps:
    - run: echo $MESSAGE >> README
      container: alpine:3
      env:
          MESSAGE: Hello world!
```

### Environment array

In this case, `steps.env` is an array. Each array item is either:

-   An object with a single property, in which case the key is used as the environment variable name and the value the value, or
-   **For src-cli execution**: A string that defines an environment variable to include from the environment `src` is being run within. This is useful to define secrets that you don't want to include in the spec file, but this makes the spec dependent on your environment, which means that the local execution cache will be invalidated each time the environment variable changes, and means that the batch spec file is no longer [the sole source of truth intended by the Batch Changes design](/batch-changes/design)
-   **For server-side execution**: A string that defines a secret value to expose as an environment variable. Follow [the guide on executor secrets](/admin/executors/executor_secrets) to set them up. The editor will suggest available secrets. This is useful to use secret values you don't want to include in the spec file. The execution cache will be invalidated each time the secret value changes, and this means that the batch spec file is no longer [the sole source of truth intended by the Batch Changes design](/batch-changes/design)

### Examples

This example is functionally the same as the [object](#environment-object) example above:

```yaml
steps:
    - run: echo $MESSAGE >> README
      container: alpine:3
      env:
          - MESSAGE: Hello world!
```

This example pulls in the `USER` environment variable, or for server-side, uses the executor secret called `USER`, and uses it to construct the line that will be appended to `README`:

```yaml
steps:
    - run: echo $MESSAGE from $USER >> README
      container: alpine:3
      env:
          - MESSAGE: Hello world!
          - USER
```

For instance, if `USER` is set to `adam`, this would append `Hello world! from adam` to `README`.

## `steps.files`

Files to create on the host machine and mount into the container when running `steps.run`. `steps.files` is an object, where the key is the name of the file _inside the container_ and the value is the content of the file.

<Callout type="note">
	`steps.files` can include [template
	variables](/batch-changes/batch-spec-templating).
</Callout>

### Examples

```yaml
steps:
    - run: cat /tmp/my-temp-file.txt >> README
      container: alpine:3
      files:
          /tmp/my-temp-file.txt: Hello world!
```

```yaml
steps:
    - run: cat /tmp/global-gitignore >> .gitignore
      container: alpine:3
      files:
          /tmp/global-gitignore: |
              # Vim
              *.swp
              # JetBrains/IntelliJ
              .idea
              # Emacs
              *~
              \#*\#
              /.emacs.desktop
              /.emacs.desktop.lock
              .\#*
              .dir-locals.el
```

## `steps.outputs`

Output variables that are set after the [`steps.run`](#steps-run) command has been executed. These variables are available in the global `outputs` namespace as `outputs.<name>` [template variables](batch_spec_templating) in the `run`, `env`, and `outputs` properties of subsequent steps, and the [`changesetTemplate`](#changesettemplate). Two steps with the same output variable name will overwrite the previous contents.

### Examples

```yaml
steps:
    - run: yarn upgrade
      container: alpine:3
      outputs:
          # Set output `friendlyMessage`
          friendlyMessage:
              value: 'Hello there!'
```

```yaml
steps:
    - run: echo "Hello there!" >> message.txt && cat message.txt
      container: alpine:3
      outputs:
          friendlyMessage:
              # `value` supports templating variables and can access the just-executed
              # step's stdout/stderr.
              value: '${{ step.stdout }}'
```

```yaml
steps:
  - run: echo "Hello there!"
    container: alpine:3
    outputs:
      stepOneOutput:
        value: "${{ step.stdout }}"
  - run: echo "We have access to the output here: ${{ outputs.stepOneOutput }}"
    container: alpine:3
    outputs:
      stepTwoOutput:
        value: "here too: ${{ outputs.stepOneOutput }}"
```

```yaml
steps:
    - run: cat .goreleaser.yml >&2
      container: alpine:3
      outputs:
          goreleaserConfig:
              value: '${{ step.stderr }}'
              # Specifying a `format` tells Sourcegraph CLI how to parse the value before
              # making it available as a template variable.
              format: yaml

changesetTemplate:
    # [...]
    body: |
        The `goreleaser.yml` defines the following `before.hooks`:
        ${{ outputs.goreleaserConfig.before.hooks }}
```

## `steps.outputs.<name>.value`

The value the output should be set to.

<Callout type="note">
	`steps.outputs.$name.value` can include [template
	variables](batch_spec_templating).
</Callout>

## `steps.outputs.<name>.format`

The format of the corresponding [`steps.outputs.<name>.value`](#outputs-value). When this is set to something other than `text`, it will be parsed as the given format.

Possible values: `text`, `yaml`, `json`. Default is `text`.

## `steps.if`

Condition to check before executing the step. If the value of the `if:` attribute is `true` (boolean) or `"true``` (string), then the step is executed in the given repository (or workspace, in case [workspaces](#workspaces) are used). Otherwise, the step is skipped.

As an optimization, the [Sourcegraph CLI](/cli/) tries to evaluate the condition _before_ starting to execute any `steps`. If the condition can be evaluated ahead of time and the result of the evaluation is false, then the execution of the step won't be attempted for the repository, which leads to better cache utilization.

Ahead-of-time evaluation is possible if the condition contains only static data. Example: `if: ${{ eq repository.name "github.com/my-org/my-repo" }}`. The repository name is known before the execution of the steps, so evaluation succeeds. Sourcegraph CLI will not include the given step in the list of steps to execute for repositories that don't have the matching name. That, in turn, allows the modification of this step's `run` attribute, for example, without invalidating the cache for the repositories in which it's never executed.

<Callout type="note">
	`steps.if` can include [templating](/batch_spec_templating).
</Callout>

### Examples

```yaml
steps:
    # `if:` is true, step always executes.
    - if: true
      run: echo "name of repository is ${{ repository.name }}" >> message.txt
      container: alpine:3
```

```yaml
steps:
    # `if:` is a static string that's not "true", step never executes.
    - if: 'random string'
      run: echo "name of repository is ${{ repository.name }}" >> message.txt
      container: alpine:3
```

```yaml
steps:
    # `if:` uses templating to check for repository name and produce a "true". Only runs in github.com/sourcegraph/automation-testing
    - if: ${{ eq repository.name "github.com/sourcegraph/automation-testing" }}
      run: echo "hello from automation-testing">> message.txt
      container: alpine:3
```

```yaml
steps:
    # `if:` uses glob pattern to match repository name and produce "true" on match.
    - if: ${{ matches repository.name "*sourcegraph-testing*" }}
      run: echo "name contains sourcegraph-testing">> message.txt
      container: alpine:3
```

```yaml
steps:
    # First step prints to standard out and saves to outputs
    - run: if [[ -f "go.mod" ]]; then echo "true"; else echo "false"; fi
      container: alpine:3
      outputs:
          goModExists:
              value: ${{ step.stdout }}

    # `if:` uses the just-set `outputs.goModExists` value as condition
    - if: ${{ outputs.goModExists }}
      run: go fmt ./...
      container: golang
```

```yaml
steps:
    # `if:` checks for path, in case steps are executed in workspace.
    - if: ${{ eq steps.path "sub/directory/in/repo"}}
      run: echo "hello workspace">> workspace.txt
      container: golang
```

## `steps.mount`

<Callout type="note">
	This feature is available only for{' '}
	<a href="https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli">
		Sourcegraph CLI
	</a>
	. Using `mount` locally is supported in Sourcegraph v3.41 and [Sourcegraph
	CLI 3.41](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli). Using
	`mount` in batch changes server-side is supported in Sourcegraph v4.1 and
	[Sourcegraph CLI
	4.0.1](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli).
</Callout>

`steps.mount` functionality makes running custom scripts/binaries easier. It mounts a local `path` to a `path` in a Docker container. Mounted paths are accessible to the step's `run` command.

A `path` can point to a file or a directory. The `path` can be **absolute** or **relative**. Regardless of the type, the path must be within the same directory as the batch spec being run (the batch spec directory is considered the **working directory**). If the batch spec is provided using standard input, the current
directory is used as the working directory.

Individual files are restricted to a **max size of 10MB**. Do not include any sensitive information in the files being uploaded.

### Examples

```yaml
# Mount a Python script and run the script
steps:
    run: python /tmp/some-script.py # execute the script located at the mountpoint
    container: python:latest
    mount:
        - path: ./some-script.py # or absolute path /my/local/path/some-script.py
          mountpoint: /tmp/some-script.py
```

```yaml
# Mount a binary and run the binary
steps:
    run: /tmp/some-binary # execute the binary located at the mountpoint
    container: alpine:latest
    mount:
        - path: ./some-binary # or absolute path /my/local/path/some-binary
          mountpoint: /tmp/some-binary
```

```yaml
# Mount a directory containing scripts and run a script from the directory
steps:
    run: python /tmp/scripts/some-script.py
    container: python:latest
    mount:
        - path: ./scripts # or absolute path /my/local/path/scripts
          mountpoint: /tmp/scripts
```

```yaml
# Mount a Python script and a directory with supporting files for the script and run the script
steps:
    run: python /tmp/some-script.py
    container: python:latest
    mount:
        - path: ./some-script.py # or absolute path /my/local/path/some-script.py
          mountpoint: /tmp/some-script.py
        - path: ./supporting-files # or absolute path /my/local/path/supporting-files
          mountpoint: /tmp/supporting-files
```

## `importChangesets`

An array describing which already-existing changesets should be imported from the code host into the batch change.

### Examples

```yaml
importChangesets:
    - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph
      externalIDs: [13323, '13343', 13342, 13380]
    - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli
      externalIDs: [260, 271]
```

## `importChangesets.repository`

The repository name as configured on your Sourcegraph instance.

## `importChangesets.externalIDs`

The changesets to import from the code host. For GitHub, this is the pull request number; for GitLab, this is the merge request number; and for Bitbucket Server, Bitbucket Data Center, or Bitbucket Cloud, this is the pull request number.

## `changesetTemplate`

A template describing how to create (and update) changesets with the file changes produced by the command steps.

This defines what the changesets on the code hosts (pull requests on GitHub, merge requests on Gitlab, etc.) will look like.

### Examples

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
    title: Replace equivalent fmt.Sprintf calls with strconv.Itoa
    body: This batch change replaces `fmt.Sprintf("%d", integer)` calls with semantically equivalent `strconv.Itoa` calls
    branch: batch-changes/sprintf-to-itoa
    commit:
        message: Replacing fmt.Sprintf with strconv.Iota
        author:
            name: Lisa Coder
            email: lisa@example.com
    published: false
```

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
    title: Update rxjs in package.json to newest version
    body: This pull request updates rxjs to the newest version, `6.6.2`.
    branch: batch-changes/update-rxjs
    commit:
        message: Update rxjs to 6.6.2
    published: true
```

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
    title: Run go fmt over all Go files
    body: Regular `go fmt` run over all our Go files.
    branch: go-fmt
    commit:
        message: Run go fmt
        author:
            name: Anna Wizard
            email: anna@example.com
    published:
        # Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.
        - git.istari.example/*: false
        - git.istari.example/anna/*: true
```

## `changesetTemplate.title`

The title of the changeset on the code host.

<Callout type="note">
	`changesetTemplate.title` can include [template
	variables](/batch-changes/batch-spec-templating).
</Callout>

## `changesetTemplate.body`

The body (description) of the changeset on the code host. If the code supports Markdown you can use it here.

<Callout type="note">
	`changesetTemplate.body` can include [template
	variables](/batch-changes/batch-spec-templating).
</Callout>

## `changesetTemplate.branch`

The name of the Git branch to create or update each repository with the changes.

If multiple branches within the same repository are matched in [`on.repository`](#on-repository), then this value must be dynamic since creating multiple branches with the same name in the same repository is impossible. This is often most easily accomplished with the `repository.branch` template variable. For example, this will create `new-feature-3.34` and `new-feature-3.35` branches:

```yaml
on:
    - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph
      branches:
          - 3.34
          - 3.35

changesetTemplate:
    branch: new-feature-${{ repository.branch }}
```

<Callout type="note">
	`changesetTemplate.branch` can include [template
	variables](/batch-changes/batch-spec-templating).
</Callout>

## `changesetTemplate.commit`

The Git commit to create with the batch changes.

## `changesetTemplate.commit.message`

The Git commit message.

<Callout type="note">
	`changesetTemplate.commit.message` can include [template
	variables](/batch-changes/batch-spec-templating).
</Callout>

## `changesetTemplate.commit.author`

The `name` and `email` of the Git commit author.

<Callout type="note">
	`changesetTemplate.commit.author` can include [template
	variables](/batch-changes/batch-spec-templating).
</Callout>

### Examples

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
    commit:
        author:
            name: Alan Turing
            email: alan.turing@example.com
```

## `changesetTemplate.published`

`changesetTemplate.published` tells whether to publish the changesets as soon as the spec is applied. This may be a boolean value (i.e., `true` or `false`), "draft", or [an array to only publish some changesets within the batch change](#publishing-only-specific-changesets). This may also be omitted, in which case the publication state will be controlled through the Sourcegraph UI and default to unpublished (the same as specifying `false`).

An unpublished changeset can be previewed on Sourcegraph by any user who can view the batch change, but its commit, branch, and pull requests aren't created on the code host.

When `published` is set to `draft`, a commit, branch, and pull request/merge request are created on the code host **in draft mode**. This means:

-   On GitHub the changeset will be a [draft pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests).
-   On GitLab, the changeset will be a merge request whose title is prefixed with "WIP:" to [flag it as a draft merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/work_in_progress_merge_requests.html#adding-the-draft-flag-to-a-merge-request).
-   On Bitbucket Server, Bitbucket Data Center, and Bitbucket Cloud, draft pull requests are not supported, and changesets published as `draft` won't be created.

<Callout type="note">
	Changesets that have already been published on a code host as a non-draft
	(`published: true`) cannot be converted to drafts. Changesets can only go
	from **unpublished** to **draft** to **published**, but not from
	**published** to **draft**. That also allows you to take it out of draft
	mode on your code host without risking Sourcegraph to revert to draft mode.
</Callout>

A published changeset creates a commit, branch, and pull request on the code host.

### Publishing only specific changesets

To publish only specific changesets within a batch change, an array of single-element objects can be provided. For example:

```yaml
published:
    - github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph: true
    - github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli: false
    - github.com/sourcegraph/batchutils: draft
```

Each key will be matched against the repository name using [glob](https://godoc.org/github.com/gobwas/glob#Compile) syntax. The [gobwas/glob library](https://godoc.org/github.com/gobwas/glob#Compile) is used for matching, with the key operators being:

| **Term**    | **Meaning**                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `*`         | Match any sequence of characters                   |
| `?`         | Match any single character                         |
| `[ab]`      | Match either `a` or `b`                            |
| `[a-z]`     | Match any character between `a` and `z`, inclusive |
| `{abc,def}` | Match either `abc` or `def`                        |

If multiple entries match a repository, the last entry will be used. For example, `github.com/a/b` will **not** be published given this configuration:

```yaml
published:
    - github.com/a/*: true
    - github.com/*: false
```

If no entries match, then the repository will not be published. To make the default true, add a wildcard entry as the first item in the array:

```yaml
published:
    - '*': true
    - github.com/*: false
```

<Callout type="note">
	The standalone `"*``` is quoted in the key to avoid ambiguity in the YAML
	document.
</Callout>

By adding a `@<branch>` at the end of a match-rule, the rule is only matched against changesets with that branch:

```yaml
published:
    - github.com/sourcegraph/src-*@my-branch: true
    - github.com/sourcegraph/src-*@my-other-branch: true
```

### Examples

To publish all changesets created by a batch change:

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
    published: true
```

To publish all changesets created by a batch change as drafts:

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
    published: draft
```

To only publish changesets within the `sourcegraph` GitHub organization:

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
    published:
        - github.com/sourcegraph/*: true
```

To publish all changesets that are not on GitLab:

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
    published:
        - '*': true
        - gitlab.com/*: false
```

To publish all changesets on GitHub as draft:

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
    published:
        - '*': true
        - github.com/*: draft
```

To publish only one of many changesets in a repository by addressing them with their branch name:

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
    published:
        - '*': true
        - github.com/sourcegraph/*@my-branch-name-1: draft
        - github.com/sourcegraph/*@my-branch-name-2: false
```

(Multiple changesets in a single repository can be produced, for example, [per project in a monorepo](/batch-changes/creating-changesets-per-project-in-monorepos) or by [transforming large changes into multiple changesets](/batch-changes/creating-multiple-changesets-in-large-repositories)).

## `changesetTemplate.fork`

<Callout type="info">
	It is supported on Sourcegraph versions 5.1 or more.
</Callout>

Whether or not each changeset should be created on a fork of the upstream repository in the namespace of the user publishing them (or the namespace of the service account if [global credentials](/batch-changes/configuring-credentials#global-service-account-tokens) are used).

This value will override the setting if the site config setting [`batchChanges.enforceForks`](/admin/config/batch_changes#forks) is enabled. For example, explicitly setting `fork: false` when the site config setting is enabled will publish changesets directly to the target repos. If omitted, the site config setting will be used.

The name of the fork Sourcegraph creates will be prefixed with the name of the original repo's namespace to prevent potential repo name collisions. For example, a batch spec targeting `github.com/my-org/project` would create or use any existing fork named `github.com/user/my-org-project`.

<Callout type="warning">
	If your code host does not support forking (e.g., Gerrit), trying to publish
	a changeset with `fork: true` will result in an error.
</Callout>

### Examples

To publish all changesets created by this batch change to forks:

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
    fork: true
```

To publish all changesets created by this batch change to the target repository:

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
    fork: false
```

## `transformChanges`

A description of how to transform the changes (diffs) produced in each repository before turning them into separate changeset specs by inserting them into the [`changesetTemplate`](#changesettemplate).

This allows the creation of multiple changeset specs (and thus changesets) in a single repository.

### Examples

```yaml
# Transform the changes produced in each repository.
transformChanges:
    # Group the file diffs by directory and produce an additional changeset per group.
    group:
        # Create a separate changeset for all changes in the top-level `go` directory
        - directory: go
          branch: my-batch-change-go # will replace the `branch` in the `changesetTemplate`

        - directory: internal/codeintel
          branch: my-batch-change-codeintel # will replace the `branch` in the `changesetTemplate`
          repository: github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli # optional: only apply the rule in this repository
```

```yaml
transformChanges:
    group:
        - directory: go/utils/time
          branch: my-batch-change-go-time

        # The *last* matching directory is used, not the most specific one,
        # so only this changeset would be opened.
        - directory: go/utils
          branch: my-batch-change-go-date
```

## `transformChanges.group`

A list of groups to define which file diffs to group together to create an additional changeset in the given repository. The **order of the list matters**, since each file diff's `filepath` is matched against the `directory` of a group, and the **last match** is used.

If no changes have been produced in a `directory`, no changeset will be created.

## `transformChanges.group.directory`

The name of the directory in which file diffs should be grouped together. The name is relative to the root of the repository.

## `transformChanges.group.branch`

The branch that should be used for this additional changeset. This **overwrites the [`changesetTemplate.branch`](#changesettemplate-branch)** when creating the additional changeset.

<Callout type="info">
	The branch cannot be nested under the
	[`changesetTemplate.branch`](#changesettemplate-branch), i.e. if the
	`changesetTemplate.branch` is `my-batch-change` then this can _not_ be
	`my-batch-change/my-subdirectory` since [git doesn't allow
	that](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22630664). Additionally, branch names must
	be unique and cannot be used as arguments for multiple `directory` fields.
</Callout>

## `transformChanges.group.repository`

(Optional) The file diffs matching the given directory will only be grouped in a repository with that name, as configured on your Sourcegraph instance.

## `workspaces`

The optional `workspaces` property allows users to define where projects are located in repositories and cause the [`steps`](#steps) to be executed for each project instead of once per repository. That allows easier creation of multiple changesets in large repositories.

For each repository yielded by [`on`](#on), a Sourcegraph search is used to get the locations of the `rootAtLocationOf` file. Each location serves as a workspace for executing the `steps` instead of the repository's root. Use the [`workspaces.in`](#workspaces-in) property to scope the definitions of workspaces. Omitting it is treated as `*`.

<Callout type="info">
	Since multiple workspaces in the same repository can produce multiple
	changesets, it's **required** to use templating to produce a unique
	[`changesetTemplate.branch`](#changesettemplate-branch) for each produced
	changeset. See the [examples](#workspaces-examples) below.
</Callout>

### Examples

Defining JavaScript projects that live in a monorepo by using the location of the `package.json` file as the root for each project:

```yaml
on:
    - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph

workspaces:
    - rootAtLocationOf: package.json
      in: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph

changesetTemplate:
    # [...]

    # Since a changeset is uniquely identified by its repository and its
    # branch we need to ensure that each changesets has a unique branch name.

    # We can use templating and helper functions get the `path` in which
    # the `steps` executed and turn that into a branch name:
    branch: my-multi-workspace-batch-change-${{ replace steps.path "/" "-"}}
```

Using templating to produce a unique branch name in repositories with workspaces and repositories without workspaces:

```yaml
on:
    - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph
    - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli

workspaces:
    - rootAtLocationOf: package.json
      in: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph

changesetTemplate:
    # [...]

    # Since the steps in `github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli` are executed in the
    # root, where path is"", we can use `join_if` to drop it from the branch name
    # if it's a blank string:
    branch: ${{ join_if "-" "my-multi-workspace-batch-change" (replace steps.path "/" "-") }}
```

Defining where Go, JavaScript, and Rust projects live in multiple repositories:

```yaml
workspaces:
    - rootAtLocationOf: go.mod
      in: github.com/sourcegraph/go-*
    - rootAtLocationOf: package.json
      in: github.com/sourcegraph/*-js
      onlyFetchWorkspace: true
    - rootAtLocationOf: Cargo.toml
      in: github.com/rusty-org/*

changesetTemplate:
    # [...]

    branch: ${{ join_if "-" "my-multi-workspace-batch-change" (replace steps.path "/" "-") }}
```

Using [`steps.outputs`](#steps-outputs) to dynamically create unique branch names:

```yaml
# [...]
on:
    # Find all repositories with a package.json file
    - repositoriesMatchingQuery: repohasfile:package.json

workspaces:
    # Define that workspaces have their root folder at the location of the
    # package.json files
    - rootAtLocationOf: package.json
      in: '*'

steps:
    # [... steps that produce changes ...]

    # Run `jq` to extract the "name" from the package.json
    - run: jq -j .name package.json
      container: jiapantw/jq-alpine:latest
      outputs:
          # Set outputs.packageName to stdout of this step's `run` command.
          packageName:
              value: ${{ step.stdout }}

changesetTemplate:
    # [...]

    # Use `outputs` variables to create a unique branch name per changeset:
    branch: my-batch-change-${{ outputs.projectName }}
```

Create changesets only on workspaces defined within subdirectories using `if:`:

```yaml
name: test-in
description: what happens in `in`?

on:
  - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph

workspaces:
  - rootAtLocationOf: package.json
    in: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph
    onlyFetchWorkspace: true

steps:
  | - run:                          |              |
  | echo Path is: ${{ steps.path }} | tee path.txt |
    container: alpine:3
    # Only creates changesets in subdirectories of client containing package.json files
    if: ${{ matches steps.path "client*" }}

changesetTemplate:
  title: Test `in`
  body: what happens in `in`?
  branch: test-in-${{ replace "/" "-" steps.path }}
  commit:
    message: Test in
```

## `workspaces.rootAtLocationOf`

The full name of the file that sits at the root of one or more workspaces in a given repository. Sourcegraph [Code Search](/code-search) is used to find the location of files with this name in the repositories returned by [`on`](#on).

For example, in a repository with the following files:

-   `packages/sourcegraph-ui/package.json`
-   `packages/sourcegraph-test-helper/package.json`

the workspace configuration

```yaml
workspaces:
    - rootAtLocationOf: package.json
      in: '*'
```

Would create **two changesets** in the repository, one in `packages/sourcegraph-ui` and one in `packages/sourcegraph-test-helper`.

## `workspaces.in`

The repositories in which the workspace should be discovered. This field supports **globbing** by using [glob](https://godoc.org/github.com/gobwas/glob#Compile) syntax. See "[Publishing only specific changesets](#publishing-only-specific-changesets)" for more information on globbing.

A repository matching multiple entries results in an error.

### Examples

Match all repository names that begin with `github.com/`:

```yaml
workspaces:
    - rootAtLocationOf: go.mod
      in: github.com/*
```

Match all repository names that begin with `gitlab.com/my-javascript-org/` and end with `-plugin`:

```yaml
workspaces:
    - rootAtLocationOf: package.json
      in: gitlab.com/my-javascript-org/*-plugin
```

## `workspaces.onlyFetchWorkspace`

When set to `true`, only the folder containing the workspace is downloaded to execute the `steps`. This field is not required; when not set, the default is `false`.

Additional files — `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` — are downloaded from the workspace location up to the repository's root. For example, with the following file layout in a repository

```
.
├── a
│   ├── b
│   │   ├── [... other files in b ...]
│   │   ├── package.json
│   │   └── .gitignore
│   │
│   ├── [... other files in a ...]
│   ├── .gitattributes
│   └── .gitignore
│
├── [... other files in root ... ]
└── .gitignore
```

and this workspace configuration

```yaml
workspaces:
    - rootAtLocationOf: package.json
      in: github.com/our-our/our-large-monorepo
      onlyFetchWorkspace: true
```

then

-   the `steps` will be executed in `b`
-   the complete contents of `b` will be downloaded and are available to the steps
-   the `.gitattributes` and `.gitignore` files in `a' will be downloaded and put in `a', **but only those**
-   the `.gitignore` files in the root will be downloaded and put in the root folder, **but only that file**

### Examples

Only download the workspaces of specific JavaScript projects in a large monorepo:

```yaml
workspaces:
    - rootAtLocationOf: package.json
      in: github.com/our-our/our-large-monorepo
      onlyFetchWorkspace: true
```
