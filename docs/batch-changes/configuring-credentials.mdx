# Configuring Credentials

<p className="subtitle">
	Learn how to configure access tokens for code hosts when creating
	changesets.
</p>

Interacting with a code host (such as creating, updating, or syncing changesets) is made possible by configuring credentials for that code host. Sourcegraph uses these credentials to manage changesets on your behalf and with your specific permissions.

## Requirements

-   Sourcegraph instance with repositories in it. Read more in the [Quickstart](/batch-changes/quickstart) guide on how to set up a Sourcegraph instance.
-   Account on the code host with access to the repositories you wish to target with your batch changes.

## Types of credentials used by Batch Changes

Batch Changes can use access tokens for all code hosts, and [GitHub apps (experimental)](#github-apps) for GitHub code hosts.

Two types of credentials can be configured to use with Batch Changes:

1. **User Credential** - A credential set by an individual Batch Changes user for their personal code host user account.
2. **Global Service Credential** (Configurable by admins only) - A credential that can be used by any Batch Changes user who does not have a personal credential configured. These are also required for [importing changesets](/batch-changes/tracking-existing-changesets) and syncing changeset state from the code host when webhooks are not configured. Although currently importing changesets is not supported without a global credential, if you’re concerned about individual user permissions, using a global credential is not recommended.

Different credentials are used for different types of operations, as shown in the table below.

-   🟢 **Preferred**: Sourcegraph will prefer to use this credential for this operation if it is configured.
-   🟡 **Fallback**: Sourcegraph will fall back to use this credential for this operation if it is configured.
-   🔴 **Unsupported**: Sourcegraph cannot use this credential for this operation.

| **Operation**                     | **User Credential** | **Global Service Credential** |
| --------------------------------- | :-----------------: | :---------------------------: |
| Pushing a branch with the changes |         🟢          |              🟡               |
| Publishing a changeset            |         🟢          |              🟡               |
| Updating a changeset              |         🟢          |              🟡               |
| Closing a changeset               |         🟢          |              🟡               |
| Importing a changeset             |         🔴          |              🟢               |
| Syncing a changeset               |         🔴          |              🟢               |

When creating a changeset on a code host, the author of the changeset will reflect the credential used (e.g., on GitHub, the user will be the pull request author). This is why a user credential is preferred for most operations.

## Personal access tokens

Personal access tokens are not strictly required if a global access token has also been configured, but users should add one if they want Sourcegraph to create changesets under their name.

<Callout type="note">
	Commit author is determined by your spec file or local `git config` at the
	time of running `src batch [apply|preview]`, completely independent from
	code host credentials.
</Callout>

### Adding personal access token

Adding a personal access token is done through the Batch Changes section of your user settings:

-   From any Sourcegraph page, click on your avatar at the top right of the page
-   Select **Settings** from the dropdown menu
-   Click **Batch Changes** on the sidebar menu
-   Click **Add credentials**, and follow the steps to [create a new token](#creating-a-code-host-token) for the code host. If the code host is GitHub, select **Personal Access Token** as the **Authentication strategy**.

	<source
		src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/videos/batch_changes/2024/user-tokens.mp4"
		type="video/mp4"
	/>
</video>

Code hosts with tokens configured are indicated by a green tick to the left of the code host name, while code hosts without credentials have an empty red circle next to them.

### Removing a personal access token

To remove a token, navigate back to the same section of your user settings, then click **Remove**:

>
	<source
		src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/videos/batch_changes/2024/removing-user-token.mp4"
		type="video/mp4"
	/>
</video>

Once the token is removed, the code host's indicator should revert to the empty red circle.

## Global service account tokens

Global credentials are usable by all users of the Sourcegraph instance who have not added their own personal access tokens for Batch Changes. This makes them a handy fallback but optional if users are adding their own tokens for publishing changesets.

However, a global service account token is currently required for [importing existing changesets](/batch-changes/tracking-existing-changesets) on your code hosts into batch changes.

Additionally, if you have not [configured webhooks](/admin/config/batch-changes#incoming-webhooks) from your code host, Sourcegraph requires a global service account to keep changesets up to date.

If [forks are enabled](/admin/config/batch-changes#forks), then note that repositories will also be forked into the service account.

### Adding a global service token

Adding a global service account token is done through the Batch Changes section of the site admin area:

-   From any Sourcegraph page, click on your avatar at the top right of the page
-   Select **Site admin** from the dropdown menu
-   Click **Settings** under the **Batch Changes** sub-heading on the sidebar menu
-   Click **Add credentials** and follow the steps to [create a new token](#creating-a-code-host-token) for the code host. If the code host is GitHub, select **Personal Access Token** as the **Authentication strategy**.

Code hosts with tokens configured are indicated by a green tick to the left of the code host name, while code hosts without credentials have an empty red circle next to them.

### Removing a global service token

To remove a token, navigate to the same section of the site admin area, then click **Remove**. Once the token is removed, the code host's indicator should revert to the empty red circle.

## Creating a code host token

To finish configuring the new credentials, you will need to create a new personal access token on your code host and paste it into the input field on the **Add credentials** modal.

![user-token-input](https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/batch_changes/2024/user-token-input.png)

Let's learn how you can do it for different code hosts.

### GitHub

On GitHub.com, create a personal access token or fine-grained access token with the correct scopes.

The `workflow` scope is technically only required if your batch changes modify files in the `.github` directory of a repository. Still, it's recommended to enable it regardless to avoid confusing errors at a later time.

When working with organizations that have SAML SSO (Single Sign On) enabled, configuring credentials requires an additional step that [involves white-listing the token for use in that organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on).

<Callout type="info">
	Currently, classic and fine-grained access tokens are supported only.
	Alternative token types like OAuth access tokens (for example, OAuth apps)
	are not supported.
</Callout>

#### Personal Access Token

Personal access tokens will have access to all repositories you have access to.

[Click here to prefill the form](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,read:org,user:email,read:discussion,workflow).

Required Scopes:

-   `repo`
-   `read:org`
-   `user:email`
-   `read:discussion`
-   `workflow`

#### Fine-Grained Access Token

Fine-grained access tokens allow more granular control of what actions can be performed for a given set of repositories. Most notably, fine-grained access tokens don't grant access by default to all repositories you have access to.

In contrast to personal access tokens, fine-grained access tokens for organization resources may be restricted, may have an expiration, and may require approval.

-   **Restriction**: If an administrator of your GitHub organization has restricted access via fine-grained access tokens, you may not be able to use them for Batch Changes
-   **Expiration**: If your organization has configured fine-grained access tokens to have maximum lifetimes, you may need to recreate the token when it has expired
-   **Approval**: If your organization has configured fine-grained access tokens to require approval, you may need to wait for an administrator to approve the token before you can use it with Batch Changes

Start by navigating to create a [new fine-grained access token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).

Pick the resource owner that owns the repositories you want to use with Batch Changes. This will likely be your company's GitHub organization.

![Select resource owner for fine-grained access token](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/docs/images/batch_changes/2025/fine_grained_select_owner.png)

Scroll down and select "All repositories" so that your token can access all current and future repositories that you have access to. You may restrict it to "Only select repositories", but you may have to generate a new token when you want to handle a new repository with Batch Changes.

![Select all repositories for repository access](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/docs/images/batch_changes/2025/fine_grained_select_repos.png)

Under "Permissions," click on the arrows on the right-hand side to expand the list of repository and organization permissions.

![Expand the repository permissions by clicking on the arrows](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/docs/images/batch_changes/2025/fine_grained_expand_permissions.png)

Under "Repository permissions", select the following permissions:

-   Contents: Read and write
-   Metadata: Read-only
-   Pull requests: Read and write
-   Workflows: Read and write

Under "Organization permissions", select the following permissions:

-   Custom properties: Read-only

Once you created the token, copy it and add it to your Batch Changes credentials.

![Add credential modal with fine-grained token selected](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/docs/images/batch_changes/2025/setup_fine_grained_access_token.png)

If your organization requires approval for fine-grained access tokens, you must wait for an administrator to approve the token before you can publish changesets with it.

The fine-grained access token is now ready to use. Create a new batch change to start using it.

### GitHub Enterprise

Follow the steps to [create a personal access token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) on GitHub Enterprise. Batch Changes requires the following scopes:

-   `repo`
-   `read:org`
-   `user:email`
-   `read:discussion`
-   `workflow`

This is done by selecting the relevant checkboxes when creating the token:

![github-token](https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/batch_changes/github-token.png)

The `workflow` scope is technically only required if your batch changes modify files in the `.github` directory of a repository, but we recommend enabling it regardless to avoid confusing errors at a later time.

When working with organizations that have SAML SSO (Single Sign On) enabled, configuring credentials requires an additional step that [involves white-listing the token for use in that organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on).

### GitLab

Follow the steps to [create a personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#creating-a-personal-access-token) on GitLab. Batch Changes requires the following scopes:

-   `api`
-   `read_repository`
-   `write_repository`

This is done by selecting the relevant checkboxes when creating the token:

![gitlab-token](https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/batch_changes/gitlab-token.png)

### Bitbucket Server/Bitbucket Data Center

Follow the steps to [create a personal access token](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver0516/personal-access-tokens-966061199.html?utm_campaign=in-app-help&utm_medium=in-app-help&utm_source=stash#Personalaccesstokens-Generatingpersonalaccesstokens) on Bitbucket.

Batch Changes require the access token to have the `write` permission on both projects and repositories. This is done by selecting the **Write** level in the **Projects** dropdown and letting repositories inherit it:

![bb-token](https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/batch_changes/bb-token.png)

### Bitbucket Cloud

On Bitbucket, follow the steps to [create an app password](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/). Batch Changes requires the following scopes:

-   `account:read`
-   `repo:read`
-   `repo:write`
-   `pr:write`
-   `pipeline:read`

![bb-cloud](https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/batch_changes/bb-cloud-app-password.png)

### Azure DevOps

Follow the steps to [create a PAT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=Windows#create-a-pat) on Azure DevOps. Batch Changes requires the following scopes:

-   `Organization:All accessible organizations`
-   `Code:Full`
-   `Code:Status`
-   `Pull Request Thread:Read & Write`
-   `User Profile:Read`

<Callout type="note">

### Gerrit

-   Permissions to create, comment, close, merge, and delete a Change in Gerrit
-   Create an HTTP password in the user settings page

![gerrit-batches-password](https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/batch_changes/gerrit-batches-password.png)

### SSH access to code host

When Sourcegraph is configured to [clone repositories using SSH via the `gitURLType` setting](/admin/repo/auth), an SSH keypair will be generated for you, and the public key needs to be added to the code host to allow push access. You will be given that public key when adding your personal access token. You can also come back later and copy and paste it into your code host's SSH access settings page.

![create-credential-ssh-key](https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/batch_changes/create-credential-ssh-key.png)

## GitHub Apps

EXPERIMENTAL: Using GitHub Apps to authenticate Batch Changes is currently experimental, and there may still be some rough edges.

GitHub apps follow the same concepts as [personal and global access tokens](#types-of-access-tokens-used-by-batch-changes).

### Limitations

-   GitHub apps can only be used with GitHub code hosts.
-   The forking mechanism (`fork:true`) is only supported if the GitHub app has access to all repositories of the installation, and if the origin repository and the fork are in the same organization that the GitHub app is installed to ([GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/forks?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-a-fork)).
-   Your network must allow bidirectional communication between Sourcegraph and GitHub.

### Migrating from PATs to GitHub Apps

You can migrate your credentials from PATs to GitHub Apps by deleting the PAT credential and creating a GitHub app credential.

Batch Changes will look at the available credentials, and pick one that matches the targeted namespace (code host, organization, repository).

You can continue to use existing batch changes without modifications.

### Adding a GitHub app

Adding a GitHub app is done through the Batch Changes section of your user settings:

-   Navigate to the credentials settings, as shown in the [personal](#personal-access-tokens) and [global service account token](#global-service-account-tokens) sections
-   Click **Add credentials**, select **GitHub App** as the **Authentication strategy** and follow the steps to create a GitHub app

</Callout>

Code hosts with GitHub apps configured are indicated by a green tick to the left of the code host name as well as details about the GitHub app on the right, while code hosts without credentials have an empty red circle next to them.

### Updating Installations and Permissions for a GitHub App

Currently, Sourcegraph doesn't handle changed installations or permissions for a GitHub app.

To update those properties, you can delete the current credential and create a new one.

### Removing a GitHub app

To remove a GitHub app from your Sourcegraph instance, navigate back to the same section of your settings, then click **Remove**. Once the GitHub app is removed, the code host's indicator should revert to the empty red circle, unless there's still a global credential configured.

		type="video/mp4"
	/>
</video>

If you want to delete the GitHub app entirely, you have to navigate to [GitHub's list of applications](https://github.com/settings/apps/) and delete it from there.
