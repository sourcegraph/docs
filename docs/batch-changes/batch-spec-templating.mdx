# Batch Spec Templating

<p className="subtitle">Understand how to use templating to make your batch changes more powerful.</p>

[Certain fields](#fields-with-template-support) in a [batch spec YAML](/batch-changes/batch-spec-yaml-reference) support templating to create even more powerful and performant batch changes. Templating in a batch spec uses the delimiters `${{` and `}}`. Inside the delimiters, [template variables](#template-variables) and [template helper functions](#template-helpers-functions) may be used to produce a text value.

## Example batch spec with templating

Here is an excerpt of a batch spec that uses templating:

```yaml
on:
  - repositoriesMatchingQuery: lang:go fmt.Sprintf("%d", :[v]) patterntype:structural -file:vendor

steps:
  - run: comby -in-place 'fmt.Sprintf("%d", :[v])' 'strconv.Itoa(:[v])' ${{ join repository.search_result_paths " " }}
    #                                                                   ^ templating starts here
    container: comby/comby
  - run: goimports -w ${{ join previous_step.modified_files " " }}
    #                 ^ templating starts here
    container: unibeautify/goimports
```

Before executing the first `run` command, `repository.search_result_paths` will be replaced with the relative-to-root-dir file paths of each search result yielded by `repositoriesMatchingQuery`. Using the [template helper function](#template-helper-functions) `join`, an argument list of whitespace-separated values is constructed.

The final `run` value that will be executed will look similar to this:

```yaml
run: comby -in-place 'fmt.Sprintf("%d", :[v])' 'strconv.Itoa(:[v])' cmd/src/main.go internal/fmt/fmt.go
```

The result is that `comby` only searches and replaces in those files instead of having to search through the complete repository.

Before the second step is executed, `previous_step.modified_files` will be replaced with the list of files that the previous `comby` step modified. It will look similar to this:

```yaml
run: goimports -w cmd/src/main.go internal/fmt/fmt.go
```

## Fields with template support

Templating is supported in the following fields:

- [`steps.run`](/batch-changes/batch-spec-yaml-reference#steps-run)
- [`steps.env`](/batch-changes/batch-spec-yaml-reference#steps-env) values
- [`steps.files`](/batch-changes/batch-spec-yaml-reference#steps-files) values
- [`steps.outputs.<name>.value`](/batch-changes/batch-spec-yaml-reference#steps-outputs)
- [`steps.if`](/batch-changes/batch-spec-yaml-reference#steps-if)
- [`changesetTemplate.title`](/batch-changes/batch-spec-yaml-reference#changesettemplate-title)
- [`changesetTemplate.body`](/batch-changes/batch-spec-yaml-reference#changesettemplate-body)
- [`changesetTemplate.branch`](/batch-changes/batch-spec-yaml-reference#changesettemplate-branch)
- [`changesetTemplate.commit.message`](/batch-changes/batch-spec-yaml-reference#changesettemplate-commit-message)
- [`changesetTemplate.commit.author.name`](/batch-changes/batch-spec-yaml-reference#changesettemplate-commit-author)
- [`changesetTemplate.commit.author.email`](/batch-changes/batch-spec-yaml-reference#changesettemplate-commit-author)

## Template variables

Template variables are the names that are defined and accessible when using templating syntax in a given context. Different variables are available depending on the context in which templating is used.

For example, in the context of `steps`, the template variable `previous_step` is available, but not in the context of `changesetTemplate`.

### `steps` context

The following template variables are available in the fields under `steps`. They are evaluated before executing each entry in `steps`, except for the `step.*` variables, which only contain values **after** the step has executed.

## Template helper functions

- `${{ join repository.search_result_paths "\n" }}` - Joins the list of strings given as the first argument with the separator as the last argument
- `${{ join_if "---" "a" "b" "" "d" }}` - Uses the first argument as a separator to join the remaining arguments, ignoring blank strings
- `${{ replace "a/b/c/d" "/" "-" }}` - Replaces occurrences of the second argument in the first one with the last one
- `${{ split repository.name "/" }}` - Splits the first argument into a list of strings at each occurrence of the last argument
- `${{ matches repository.name "github.com/my-org/terra*" }}` - Matches the first argument against the glob pattern in the second argument, returning true/false
- `${{ "${{ repository.name }}" }}` - Outputs the inner expression as a literal string, for example, to [ignore the inner set of `${{ }}`](/batch-changes/faq#how-can-i-use-github-expression-syntax---literally-in-my-batch-spec)

The features of Go's [`text/template`](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) package are also available, including conditionals and loops, since it is the underlying templating engine.

## Templating Examples

Pass the exact list of search result file paths to a command:

```yaml
steps:
  - run: comby -in-place -config /tmp/go-sprintf.toml -f ${{ join repository.search_result_paths "," }}
    container: comby/comby
    files:
      /tmp/go-sprintf.toml: |
        [sprintf_to_strconv]
        match='fmt.Sprintf("%d", :[v])'
        rewrite='strconv.Itoa(:[v])'
```

Run a command for each search result file path:

```yaml
steps:
  - run: |
      for file in "${{ join repository.search_result_paths " " }}";
      do
        sed -i 's/mydockerhub-user/ci-dockerhub-user/g;' ${file}
      done
    container: alpine:3
```

Format and fix files after a previous step modified them:

```yaml
steps:
  | - run:                                              |   |
  | find . -type f -name '*.go' -not -path "*/vendor/*" | \ |
      xargs sed -i 's/fmt.Println/log.Println/g'
    container: alpine:3
  - run: goimports -w ${{ join previous_step.modified_files " " }}
    container: unibeautify/goimports
```

Use the `steps.files` combined with template variables to construct files inside the container:

```yaml
steps:
  | - run:                  |                  |
  | cat /tmp/search-results | while read file; |
      do
        | ruplacer --subvert whitelist allowlist --go ${file} | | echo "nothing to replace"; |
        | ruplacer --subvert blacklist denylist --go ${file}  | | echo "nothing to replace"; |
      done
    container: ruplacer
    files:
      /tmp/search-results: ${{ join repository.search_result_paths "\n" }}
```

Put information in environment variables, based on the output of previous step `steps.env` also

```yaml
steps:
  - run: echo $LINTER_ERRROS >> linter_errors.txt
    container: alpine:3
    env:
      LINTER_ERRORS: ${{ previous_step.stdout }}
```

If you need to escape the `${{` and `}}` delimiters you can simply render them as string literals:

```yaml
steps:
  - run: cp /tmp/escaped.txt .
    container: alpine:3
    files:
      /tmp/escaped.txt: ${{ "${{" }} ${{ "}}" }}
```

Accessing the `outputs` set by `steps` in subsequent `steps` and the `changesetTemplate`:

```yaml
steps:
  - run: echo "Hello there!"
    container: alpine:3
    outputs:
      myFriendlyMessage:
        value: "${{ step.stdout }}"
  - run: echo "We have access to the output here: ${{ outputs.myFriendlyMessage }}"
    container: alpine:3
    outputs:
      stepTwoOutput:
        otherMessage: "here too: ${{ outputs.myFriendlyMessage }}"

changesetTemplate:
  # [...]
  body: |
    The first step left us the following message: ${{ outputs.myFriendlyMessage }}
    The second step left this one: ${{ outputs.otherMessage }}
```

Using the [`steps.outputs.<name>.format`](/batch-changes/batch-spec-yaml-reference#steps-outputs-name-format) field, it's possible to parse the value of output as JSON or YAML and access it as a data structure instead of just text:

```yaml
steps:
  - run: cat .goreleaser.yml
    container: alpine:3
    outputs:
      goreleaserConfig:
        value: "${{ step.stdout }}"
        # The step's output is parsed as YAML, making it accessible as a YAML
        # object in the other templating fields.
        format: yaml
      goreleaserConfigExists:
        # We can use the power of Go's text/template engine to dynamically produce complex values
        value: "exists: ${{ gt (len step.stderr) 0 }}"
        format: yaml

changesetTemplate:
  # [...]

  # Since templating fields use Go's `text/template` and `goreleaserConfig` was
  # parsed as YAML we can iterate over every field:
  body: |
    This repository has a `gorelaserConfig`: ${{ outputs.goreleaserConfigExists.exists }}.

    The `goreleaser.yml` defines the following `before.hooks`:

    ${{ range $index, $hook := outputs.goreleaserConfig.before.hooks }}
    - `${{ $hook }}`
    ${{ end }}
```

Using the [`steps.if`](/batch-changes/batch-spec-yaml-reference#steps-if) field to conditionally execute different steps in different repositories:

```yaml
steps:
  # `if:` is true, step always executes.
  - if: true
    run: echo "name of repository is ${{ repository.name }}" >> message.txt
    container: alpine:3

  # `if:` checks for repository name. Only runs in github.com/sourcegraph/automation-testing
  - if: ${{ eq repository.name "github.com/sourcegraph/automation-testing" }}
    run: echo "hello from automation-testing" >> message.txt
    container: alpine:3

  # `if:` uses glob pattern to match repository name.
  - if: ${{ matches repository.name "*sourcegraph-testing*" }}
    run: echo "name contains sourcegraph-testing" >> message.txt
    container: alpine:3

  # Checks for go.mod existence and saves to outputs
  - run:  if [[ -f "go.mod" ]]; then echo "true"; else echo "false"; fi
    container: alpine:3
    outputs:
      goModExists:
        value: ${{ step.stdout }}

  # `if:` uses the just-set `outputs.goModExists` value as condition
  - if: ${{ outputs.goModExists }}
    run: go fmt ./...
    container: golang

  # `if:` checks for path, in case steps are executed in workspace.
  - if: ${{ eq steps.path "sub/directory/in/repo" }}
    run: echo "hello workspace" >> workspace.txt
    container: golang
```

Combine the [template helper functions](#template-helpers-functions) with the helper functions built into Go's [`text/template`](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) library:

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
  # [...]
  body: |
    The host of the repository: ${{ index (split repository.name "/") 0 }}
    The org of the repository: ${{ index (split repository.name "/") 1 }}
```

Render the batch change link at the beginning of the changeset body:

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
  # [...]
  body: |
    ${{ batch_change_link }}

    This is the rest of my changeset description.
```
