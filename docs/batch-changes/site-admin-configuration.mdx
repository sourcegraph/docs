# Site Admin Configuration for Batch Changes

<p className="subtitle">
	Learn what configuration permissions site admins have with Batch Changes.
</p>

Using Batch Changes requires a [code host connection](/admin/code_hosts/) to a supported code host (currently GitHub, Bitbucket Server/Bitbucket Data Center, GitLab, and Bitbucket Cloud). Site admins can configure the following when setting and disabling Batch Changes:

## Set up Batch Changes

-   [Configure which users have access to Batch Changes](/admin/access_control/batch_changes) (Beta): By default, all users can create and view batch changes, but only the batch change's author or a site admin can administer a given batch change
    -   Additionally, you can also [customize org settings](/admin/config/batch_changes#enable-organization-members-to-administer) to allow members of an organization to share administration privileges over batch changes created in that organization
-   (Optional) [Configure repository permissions](/admin/permissions/), that Batch Changes will follow
-   [Configure credentials](/batch-changes/configuring-credentials)
-   [Setup incoming webhooks](/admin/config/webhooks/incoming) to make sure changesets sync fast. Learn more about [Batch Changes effect on code host rate limits](/batch-changes/requirements#batch-changes-effect-on-code-host-rate-limits)
-   Configure any desired optional features, such as:
    -   [Rollout windows](/admin/config/batch_changes#rollout-windows), which control the rate at which Batch Changes will publish changesets on code hosts
    -   [Forks](/admin/config/batch_changes#forks), which push branches created by Batch Changes onto forks of the upstream repository instead of the repository itself
    -   [Outgoing webhooks](/admin/config/webhooks/outgoing), which publish events related to batch changes and changesets to enable deeper integrations with your other tools and systems
    -   [Auto-delete branch on merge/close](/admin/config/batch_changes#automatically-delete-branches-on-merge-close), which automatically deletes branches created by Batch Changes when changesets are merged or closed
    -   [Commit signing for GitHub](/admin/config/batch_changes#commit-signing-for-github), which signs commits created by Batch Changes via a GitHub App (Beta)
    -   [Batch spec library](/admin/config/batch_changes#batch-spec-library), which help your users write batch specs and follow best practices

## Disable Batch Changes

-   [Disable Batch Changes](/batch-changes/permissions-in-batch-changes#disabling-batch-changes).
