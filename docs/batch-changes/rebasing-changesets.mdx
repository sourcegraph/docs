# Rebasing changesets

<p className="subtitle">Learn how to rebase your existing changesets.</p>

<Callout type="note">This feature is supported for Sourcegraph versions 6.2 or more.</Callout>

If your codehost requires changesets to be up to date with the main branch, you can use the rebase functionality of the Web UI to update the changesets.

<Callout type="warning">Rebasing does not resolve merge conflicts.</Callout>

## Requirements

- Sourcegraph instance with repositories in it. See the [Quickstart](/#quick-install) guide on how to set up a Sourcegraph instance
- A [global service account token](/batch-changes/configuring-credentials#global-service-account-tokens) for Batch Changes (**a personal access token cannot currently be used for importing changesets**)

## Select changesets to rebase

After navigating to the changesets of your batch change, select one or more **published** changesets to rebase. You can only rebase changesets after they have been published to the codehost.

If a changeset is already up to date with the main branch, rebasing will result in no changes.

## Start the rebase bulk operation

With all applicable changesets selected, click the **Select action** button, and then select **Rebase changesets**.
