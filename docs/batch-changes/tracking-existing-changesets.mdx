# Tracking existing changesets

<p className="subtitle">Learn how to track your existing changesets.</p>

Batch Changes allow you not only to [publish changesets](/batch-changes/publishing-changesets) but also to **import and track changesets** that already exist on different code hosts. That allows you to get an overview of the status of multiple changesets, with the ability to filter and drill down into the details of a specific changeset. After you have successfully imported changesets, you can perform the following bulk actions:

-   Write comments on each of the imported changesets
-   Merge each of the imported changesets to main
-   Close each of the imported changesets

## Requirements

-   Sourcegraph instance with repositories in it. See the [Quickstart](/#quick-install) guide on how to set up a Sourcegraph instance
-   A [global service account token](/batch-changes/configuring-credentials#global-service-account-tokens) for Batch Changes (**a personal access token cannot currently be used for importing changesets**)

## Importing changesets into a batch change

To track existing changesets in a batch change, you add them to the [batch spec](/batch-changes/create-a-batch-change#writing-a-batch-spec) under the `importChangesets` property and apply the batch spec.

The following example batch spec tracks multiple existing changesets in different repositories on different code hosts:

```yaml
name: track-important-milestone
description: Track all changesets related to our important milestone

importChangesets:
    - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph
      externalIDs: [15397, 15590, 15597, 15583, 15806, 15798]
    - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli
      externalIDs: [378, 373, 374, 369, 368, 361, 380]
    - repository: bitbucket.sgdev.org/SOUR/vegeta
      externalIDs: [8]
    - repository: gitlab.sgdev.org/sourcegraph/src-cli
      externalIDs: [113, 119]
```

You can learn more about how to create a batch spec from our [creating a batch change](/batch-changes/create-a-batch-change) docs.

<Callout type="note">
	You can combine the tracking of existing changesets and creating new ones by
	adding `importChangesets:` to your batch specs that have `on:`, `steps:` and
	`changesetTemplate:` properties.
</Callout>

Once you've created the batch change, you'll see the existing changeset in the list of changesets. The batch change will track the changeset's status and include it in the overall batch change progress (in the same way as if the batch change had created it).
