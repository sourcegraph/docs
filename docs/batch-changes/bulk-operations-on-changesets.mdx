# Bulk Operations on Changesets

<p className="subtitle">These docs explain how to perform bulk operations on changesets.</p>

Bulk operations allow a single action to be performed across many changesets in a batch change.

## Selecting changesets for a bulk operation

To perform a bulk operation on changesets,

- Click the checkbox next to a changeset in the list view. You can select all changesets you have permission to view

![select_changeset](https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/batch_changes/select_changeset.png)

- If you like, select all changesets in the list by using the checkbox in the list header. To select **all** changesets that meet the filters and search currently set, click the **(Select XX changesets)** link in the header toolbar

- Next, from the top right, select the action to perform on all the changesets

![select_bulk_operation_type](https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/batch_changes/select_bulk_operation_type.png)

- Once changesets are selected, a query is made to determine the bulk operations that can be applied to the selected changesets

## Supported types of bulk operations

Depending on the changesets selected, different types of bulk operations can be applied to the selected changesets. For a bulk operation to be available, it has to be applicable to all the selected changesets.

Below is a list of supported bulk operations for changesets and the conditions with which they're applicable:

|        **Types**         |                                                                                                                                                                                             **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Commenting**           | Post a comment on all selected changesets. Useful for pinging people, reminding them to take a look at the changeset, or posting your favorite emoji                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Detach**               | Detach a selection of changesets from the batch change to remove them from the archived tab                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Re-enqueue**           | Re-enqueues the pending changes for all selected changesets that failed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Merge (experimental)** | Merge the selected changesets on code hosts. Some changesets may be unmergeable due to their states, which does not impact the overall bulk operation. Failed merges are listed under the bulk operations tab. In the confirmation modal, you can opt for a squash merge strategy, available on GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket Cloud. For Bitbucket Server/Data Center, only regular merges are performed |
| **Close**                | Close the selected changesets on the code hosts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Publish**              | Publishes the selected changesets, provided they don't have a [`published` field](/batch-changes/batch-spec-yaml-reference#changesettemplate-published) in the batch spec. You can choose between draft and normal changesets in the confirmation modal                                                                                                                                       |

## Monitoring bulk operations

On the **Bulk operations** tab, you can view all bulk operations that have been run over the batch change. Some bulk operations can involve quite some operations to perform, you can track the progress, and see what operations have been performed in the past.
