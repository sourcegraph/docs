# Cody Pricing

<p className="subtitle">Learn about the different plans available for Cody.</p>

Cody provides three subscription plans: **Free**, **Pro**, and **Enterprise**. Each plan is aimed to cater to a diverse range of users, from individual projects to large-scale enterprises. Cody Free includes basic features, while the Pro and Enterprise plans offer additional advanced features and resources to meet varying user requirements.

## Free

The free plan is designed for individuals to get started with Cody. It comes with a set of features to enhance your coding experience. It includes **500 autocompletion suggestions** per month, covering both whole and multi-line suggestions. You also get **20 chats/commands** per month with access to creating Custom Commands.

The free plan provides access to local context with keyword search and embeddings on open-source code via Sourcegraph.com. You get **200 MB** of embeddings over your lifetime and can manage these from the user settings in VS Code, with JetBrains IDE support coming soon. If you embed 150 MB of code, you can only embed another 50 MB of code. If you delete that 150 MB of code embedding, the original 200 MB of code embeddings will be available again.

The free plan ensures local context utilization and allows you to seamlessly integrate Cody into your preferred client, whether it's VSCode, JetBrains, or Neovim. Finally, you'll have default support with Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet for Chat and Commands) and StarCoder as the officially supported LLMs.

### Billing cycle

There is no billing cycle for Cody Free, as it is free to use. If you complete your monthly autocompletions or chat/commands limit, you'll be prompted to upgrade to the Pro plan. Otherwise, you'll have to wait approximately 30 days for the limits to reset.

The reset date is based on your sign-up date. For example, if you sign up on December 15th, your limit will reset on January 15th.
