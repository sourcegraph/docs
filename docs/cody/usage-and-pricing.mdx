# Cody Pricing

<p className="subtitle">Learn about the different plans available for Cody.</p>

Cody provides three subscription plans: **Free**, **Pro**, and **Enterprise**. Each plan is aimed to cater to a diverse range of users, from individual projects to large-scale enterprises. Cody Free includes basic features, while the Pro and Enterprise plans offer additional advanced features and resources to meet varying user requirements.

## Free

The free plan is designed for individuals to get started with Cody. It comes with a set of features to enhance your coding experience. It includes **unlimited autocompletion suggestions** per month, covering both whole and multi-line suggestions. You also get **200 chats/prompts** per month with access to creating custom prompts.

The free plan provides access to local context to enhance Cody's understanding of your code and ability to provide accurate suggestions. Local context uses keyword search to search the local repository (the one currently open in your IDE).

Cody Free uses the DeepSeek-Coder-V2 model for autocomplete. It uses the Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New) model for chat and prompts, and users have several other model options they can switch to. See [Supported LLMs](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody/capabilities/supported-models) for more information.

### Billing cycle

There is no billing cycle for Cody Free, as it is free to use. If you complete your monthly chat/prompts limit, you'll be prompted to upgrade to the Pro plan. Otherwise, you'll have to wait approximately 30 days for the limits to reset.

The reset date is based on your sign-up date. For example, if you sign up on December 15th, your limit will reset on January 15th.
