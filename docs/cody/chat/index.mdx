# Chat

<p className="subtitle">Use chat to get contextually-aware answers to your code questions.</p>

The chat experience combines light code search, AI chat, and agent capabilities into a unified interface for developers. It's designed to accelerate the entire developer workflow by providing a more intuitive and powerful way to interact with code.

You can do it from the **chat** panel of the supported editor extensions ([VS Code](/cody/clients/install-vscode), [JetBrains](/cody/clients/install-jetbrains), [Visual Studio](/cody/clients/install-visual-studio), [Eclispe](/cody/clients/install-eclipse)) or in the [web](/cody/clients/cody-with-sourcegraph) app.

## Key features

### Intent detection

Automatically analyzes user queries and determines whether to provide an AI chat response or a search response.

### Smart search integration

Provides lightweight code search capabilities directly within the chat interface.

### Context-aware responses

Search results can be automatically used as context for follow-up queries.

## Prerequisites

To use Cody's chat, you'll need the following:

- A Free or Pro account via Sourcegraph.com or a Sourcegraph Enterprise account
- A supported editor extension (VS Code, JetBrains, Visual Studio) installed

## How does chat work?

The following is a general walkthrough of the chat experience:

1. User enters a query in the chat interface
2. System analyzes the query through intent detection
3. If it's a search query:
   - Displays ranked results with code snippets
   - Shows personalized repository ordering
   - Provides checkboxes to select context for follow-ups
4. If it's a chat query:
   - Delivers AI-powered responses
   - Can incorporate previous search results as context
5. Users can:
   - Switch between search and chat modes
   - Click on results to open files in their editor
   - Ask follow-up questions using selected context
   - Use `@` to add context for specific files, symbols, remote repositories, or other non-code artifacts
