# Chat

<p className="subtitle">Use Cody's chat to get contextually-aware answers to your questions.</p>

You can **chat** with Cody to ask questions about your code, generate code, and edit code. By default, Cody has the context of your open file and entire repository, and you can use `@` to add context for specific files, symbols, remote repositories, or other non-code artifacts.

You can do it from the **chat** panel of the supported editor extensions ([VS Code](/cody/clients/install-vscode), [JetBrains](/cody/clients/install-jetbrains), [Visual Studio](/cody/clients/install-visual-studio), [Eclispe](/cody/clients/install-eclipse)) or in the [web](/cody/clients/cody-with-sourcegraph) app.

## Prerequisites

To use Cody's chat, you'll need the following:

- A Free or Pro account via Sourcegraph.com or a Sourcegraph Enterprise account
- A supported editor extension (VS Code, JetBrains, Visual Studio) installed

## How does chat work?

Cody answers questions by searching your codebase and retrieving context relevant to your questions. Cody uses several methods to search for context, including Sourcegraph's native search and keyword search. Finding and using context allows Cody to make informed responses based on your code rather than being limited to general knowledge. When Cody retrieves context to answer a question, it will tell you which code files it reads to generate its response.

Cody can assist you with various use cases, such as:

- Generating an API call: Cody can analyze your API schema to provide context for the code it generates
- Locating a specific component in your codebase: Cody can identify and describe the files where a particular component is defined
- Handling questions that involve multiple files, like understanding data population in a React app: Cody can locate React component definitions, helping you understand how data is passed and where it originates
