## VS Code extension

### Cody is not responding in chat

If you're experiencing issues with Cody not responding in chat, follow these steps:

- Ensure you have the latest version of the [Cody VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-ai). Use the VS Code command `Extensions: Check for Extension Updates` to verify
- Check the VS Code error console for relevant error messages. To open it, run the VS Code command `Developer: Toggle Developer Tools` and then look in the `Console` for relevant messages

### Access Cody logs

VS Code logs can be accessed via the **Outputs** view. To access logs, you need to enable Cody logs in verbose mode. To do so:

- Go to the Cody Extension Settings and enable: `Cody › Debug: Enable` and `Cody › Debug: Verbose`
- Restart or reload your VS Code editor
- You can now see the logs in the Outputs view
- Open the view via the menu bar: `View > Output`
- Select **Cody by Sourcegraph** from the dropdown list

### Errors trying to install Cody on macOS

If you encounter the following errors:

```bash
Command 'Cody: Set Access Token' resulted in an error

Command 'cody.set-access-token' not found
```

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

- Close your VS Code editor
- Open your Keychain Access app
- Search for `cody`
- Delete the `vscodesourcegraph.cody-ai` entry in the system keychain on the left
- Reopen the VS Code editor. This should resolve the error

### Signin fails on each VS Code restart

If you find yourself being automatically signed out of Cody every time you restart VS Code, and suspect it's due to keychain authentication issues, you can address this by following the steps provided in the official VS Code documentation on [troubleshooting keychain issues](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync#_troubleshooting-keychain-issues). These guidelines should help you troubleshoot and resolve any keychain-related authentication issues, ensuring a seamless experience with Cody on VS Code.

### No context files were included by Cody

If Cody's answers don't seem accurate, it may be because Cody is unable to find the right relevant files to use as context. You can see which files Cody used in the **Context** row right below your message.

To troubleshoot further:

1. Enable the `cody.debug.verbose` setting in your VS Code user settings.
1. Open the **Cody by Sourcegraph** output channel in VS Code.
1. Look for log messages such as the following:

```bash
█ SimpleChatPanelProvider: getEnhancedContext > embeddings (start)
█ SimpleChatPanelProvider: getEnhancedContext > searching local embeddings
█ SimpleChatPanelProvider: getEnhancedContext > embeddings (end)
█ SimpleChatPanelProvider: getEnhancedContext > search
█ symf: using downloaded symf "/Users/beyang/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/sourcegraph.cody-ai/symf/symf-v0.0.6-aarch64-macos"
█ SimpleChatPanelProvider: getEnhancedContext > search (end)
█ DefaultPrompter.makePrompt: Ignored 8 additional context items due to limit reached
```

### Rate limits

On the free plan, Cody provides **unlimited autocomplete suggestions** and **200 chat and command invokations** per user per month.

On the Pro and Enterprise plans, there are much higher limits that are used to keep our services operational. These limits reset within a day.

### Error logging in VS Code on Linux

If you encounter difficulties logging in to Cody on Linux using your Sourcegraph instance URL, along with a valid access token, and notice that the sign-in process in VS Code hangs, it might be related to underlying networking rules concerning SSL certificates.

To address this, follow these steps:

- Close your VS Code editor
- In your terminal, type and run the following command: `echo "export NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0">> ~/.bashrc`
- Restart VS Code and try the sign in process again

### Error exceeding `localStorage` quota

When using Cody chat, you may come across this error:

```bash
Failed to execute 'setItem' on 'Storage': Setting the value of 'user-history:$user_id' exceeded the quota.
```

This error indicates that the chat history size surpasses the capacity of your browser's local storage. Cody stores comprehensive context data with each chat message, contributing to this limitation.

To fix this, navigate to https://sourcegraph.example.com/cody/chat and click `Clear Chat History` if your instance is on v5.2.3+. For older versions, clear your browsing data or browser history.

### Record performance traces for Cody

You can get performance traces from the Cody VS Code extension in production with full support for source maps. To do so:

- Start VS Code with a special runtime flag. In macOS, you can do so via the terminal like this:

```bash
/Applications/Visual\ Studio\ Code.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron --inspect-extensions=9333
```
Note that you may need to quit VSCode first, then run that command to re-launch it. It will open all of your windows and tabs again.
- After VS Code is started, head over to Chrome and go to `chrome://inspect`, which takes you to the following:

- Configure the inspect server you started on port `9333` from here. To do so, click on **Open dedicated DevTools for Node**, then go to the **Connection** tab, and make sure to add `localhost:9333` to the list

![](https://gist.github.com/assets/458591/972ce113-88f0-482a-99b7-5e51957981ef)

- Now head back to the `chrome://inspect` tab, and you should see a new remote target that you can inspect

![](https://gist.github.com/assets/458591/06b2e293-aea7-42e8-a9cc-592863b6fb07)

- Clicking this will open a (somewhat reduced) DevTools view. Great! We've almost got it. From here you can go to the **Performance** tab to record a trace. And finally, swap tabs to the VS Code window and interact with the extension. Come back later to stop the recording and export it.
