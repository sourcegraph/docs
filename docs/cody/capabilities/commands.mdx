# Prompts and Commands

<p className="subtitle">Learn how prompts and commands can kick-start your workflow.</p>

## Prompts

<Callout type="note">Prompts and Prompts Library are currently available in Cody's VS Code extension and the Sourcegraph Web UI.</Callout>

Apart from these ready-to-use commands, you can create your own prompts from the **Prompt Library** via the Sourcegraph's Web UI. From here, you can easily create, edit, share, and discover prompts you’ve created or have been shared within your organization.

## Prompt Library

The Prompt Library can be accessed from the **Tools > Prompt Library** in the top navigation bar in Sourcegraph's web UI. From here, you can view, create or edit a prompt. You can also search for prompts, filter the list to find a specific prompt by owner, and sort by name or recently updated.

![prompt-library-overview](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/prompt-library-overview-0824.png)

### Create and edit a prompt

Click the **New prompt** button on the **Prompt Library** page to create a new prompt.

- Select the **Owner** and **Name** of the prompt
- Then, write a prompt description
- And finally, fill out the **Prompt template** box with all your prompt instructions
- Moreover, you can mark your prompt as **Draft**.
- Once done, click the **Create prompt** button

The prompt is visible to and usable by:

- The prompt's owner: if the prompt's owner is a user
- All members of the organization: if the prompt's owner is an organization
- Everyone: if the prompt is marked **Public** (which only site admins can do)

Completing this process will do the following:

- The new prompt will be added to the **Prompt Library** page
- The prompt will appear in the Prompts list in Cody (in the editor and on the web)

### Draft prompts

You can mark your prompt as a draft. A draft prompt cannot be seen by anyone but you. You can only see and modify your draft prompts via the **Prompt Library** via the Sourcegraph's Web UI.

### Editing a prompt

To edit a prompt, click the Edit button next to the prompt in the Prompt Library and make the necessary changes. You can also use this interface to **transfer ownership** of the prompt or delete it from this view.


### Using prompts

Prompts work in the same way as commands. Inside Cody's chat window there is a drop-down called **prompts** next to the LLM selector. Use this to select a prompt and run on your codebase.

## Promoted Prompts

<Callout type="note">Promoted Prompts are supported in VS Code and Cody Web.</Callout>

Promoted Prompts allow admins to highlight Prompts to users at the top of a Prompt list in Cody chat, directing users to use specific Prompts that encourage best practices within the organization. Admins can promote a Prompt by checking the Promoted box in the Prompt edit screen.

![promote-a-prompt](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/promote-promt-1024.png)

Promoted Prompts are marked with an icon next to their name and appear at the top of the Prompt list in the Cody chat window in an IDE and the Prompt Library.

## Commands

Cody offers quick, ready-to-use **commands** for common actions to write, describe, fix, and smell code. These allow you to run predefined actions with smart context-fetching anywhere in the editor. Like autocomplete and chat, commands will search for context in your codebase to provide more contextually aware and informed answers.

Commands are available in VS Code, JetBrains, and the Sourcegraph web app. Commands can handle tasks like:

- Editing and fixing code `edit`
- Explaining code `explain`
- Generating unit tests `test`
- Writing documentation `doc`
- Improving code quality `smell`

Support for commands may vary by IDE extension. Read the [feature parity reference to learn what commands are available in your IDE](/cody/clients/feature-reference#commands).

<Callout type="note">Cody’s responses to commands are often better than responses to chats since they’ve been pre-packaged and prompt-engineered.</Callout>

## Running commands

The process of running a command varies from one IDE to another. For example, in VS Code, there are several ways to run a command:

1. Select code in the editor and use the Cody commands sidebar to run a command:

<video width="1920" height="1080" loop playsInline controls style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}>
	<source src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/Media/code-comments-cody-0724.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
	</video>

2. Run **Cody: Commands** in the VS Code command palette.
3. Right-click in the editor and select a command in the **Cody** submenu.

## Custom commands

<Callout type="info">Custom Commands are currently in Beta and only supported in VS Code.</Callout>

**Custom Commands** allow you to create and define reusable [prompts](#prompts) for Cody tailored to your development workflows. They are defined in `JSON` format and will enable you to call CLI tools, write custom prompts, and select context to be sent to Cody. This provides a flexible way to configure Cody to handle use cases like:

- Integrate with your build system to suggest fixes for errors/warnings in the latest build
- Analyze software dependencies output to explain compatibility or suggest upgrades
- Read test command failures to explain and suggest fixes
- Explain code quality output like linter warnings

### Creating a Custom Command

You can create a custom command by editing the configuration JSON file or using the command builder within the VS Code editor. To access the command builder within VS Code:

- Open the Cody commands menu (**Cody: Commands** in the command palette)
- Select **Custom commands > New Custom Command**
- Enter the name for your new custom command, such as `my-custom-command`.
- Next, write a description for the command. For example, `Compare files in open tabs` or `Explain current directory`
- Provide the relevant instructions for Cody to follow. This is the `prompt` that Cody will use to pass relevant context to the LLM
- Then, select one or more options for the context Cody should use to generate responses
- Finally, choose whether to save the command locally or share it with your workspace
- Press **Enter** to complete the process, and your custom command is successfully created
- You can hit `esc` key at any time to discard a new custom command

### Running Custom Commands

You can invoke custom commands in 2 ways.

- Run **Cody Command: Custom Commands** in the VS Code command palette.
- Right-click in the editor and select **Cody > Custom Commands**.

Then select the command you want to run. If your custom command expects a code selection, be sure to select code in the editor before running the custom command.

### Configuring file paths

Custom Commands can be defined in the following two file paths:

- **User Settings (`~/.vscode/cody.json`)**: Stored locally. Use this for personal commands to use across all your projects
- **Workspace Settings (`.vscode/cody.json`)**: Stored in your project’s repository. Use this to share commands with others working on the same codebase and for project-specific commands

If you select **User Settings**, the new custom command will only be available to you. If you select **Workspace Settings** (as an enterprise user), the custom command will also be available to your teammates.

See the [examples](#examples) and [configuration properties](#configuration-properties) below for more details on configuring custom commands.

Explain the key files, functions, classes, and features. Use Markdown formatting for headings, code blocks, lists, etc. to make the it organized and readable. Aim for a beginner-friendly explanation that gives a developer unfamiliar with the code a good starting point to understand it. Make sure to include: - Overview of directory purpose - Functionality explanations - Relevant diagrams or visuals if helpful. Write the README content clearly and concisely using complete sentences and paragraphs based on the shared context. Use proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation throughout.

{/* <!-- ### Defining commands in the `cody.json` file

You can define custom commands for Cody in the `cody.json` file. To make commands only available for a specific project, create the `cody.json` file in that project's `.vscode` directory. When you work on that project, these workspace-specific custom commands will be available.

To make custom commands globally available across multiple projects, create a new `cody.json` file in your home directory's `.vscode` folder. These global custom commands will be available in Cody in any workspace. --> */}

<Callout type="note">Commands and Custom Commands are soon going to be replaced by [prompts](#prompts) and [Prompt Library](#prompt-library) in the coming future.</Callout>
