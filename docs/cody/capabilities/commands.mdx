# Prompts

<p className="subtitle">Learn how prompts can automate and kick-start your workflow with Cody.</p>

Cody offers quick, ready-to-use **Prompts** to automate key tasks in your workflow. Prompts are created and saved in the **Prompt Library** and can be accessed from the **Tools > Prompt Library** in the top navigation bar in Sourcegraph's web UI.

From here, you can easily create, edit, share, and discover prompts youâ€™ve created or have been shared within your organization. You can also search for prompts, filter the list to find a specific prompt by owner, and sort by name or recently updated.

### Create and edit a prompt

Click the **New prompt** button on the **Prompt Library** page to create a new prompt.

- Select the **Owner** and **Prompt Name**
- Next, write a prompt description
- Finally, fill out the **Prompt template** box with all your prompt instructions
- You can also add dynamic context that will allow your prompt to use content from different sources like current selection and current file
- Select the visibility of the prompt, either **Public** or **Private**
- Once done, click the **Create prompt** button

A few advanced options exist to create a prompt that you can configure. They are in the Advanced section.

The prompt is visible to and usable by:

- **The prompt's owner**: If the prompt's owner is a user
- **All members of the organization**: If the prompt's owner is an organization
- **Everyone**: If the prompt is marked **Public** (which only site admins can do)

Completing this process will do the following:

- The new prompt will be added to the **Prompt Library** page
- The prompt will appear in the Prompts list in the Cody chat panel (in the editor and on the web)

### Draft prompts

You can mark your prompt as a draft. A draft prompt is not visible to everyone. You can only see and modify your draft prompts via the **Prompt Library** via the Sourcegraph's Web UI.

### Editing a prompt

To edit a prompt, click the Edit button next to the prompt in the Prompt Library and make the necessary changes. You can also use this interface to **transfer ownership** of the prompt or delete it from this view.

### Using prompts

Prompts work in the same way as commands. Inside Cody's chat window is a drop-down called **prompts** next to the LLM selector. Use this to select a prompt and run on your codebase.

## Promoted Prompts

<Callout type="note">Promoted Prompts are supported in VS Code and Cody Web.</Callout>

Promoted Prompts allow admins to highlight Prompts to users at the top of a Prompt list in Cody chat, directing users to use specific Prompts that encourage best practices within the organization. Admins can promote a Prompt by checking the Promoted box in the Prompt edit screen.

Promoted Prompts are marked with an icon next to their name and appear at the top of the Prompt list in the Cody chat window in an IDE and the Prompt Library.
