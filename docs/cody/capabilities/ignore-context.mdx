# Ignoring Context with Cody

<Callout type="experimental">This feature is currently in the Experimental stage.</Callout>  

This guide will walk you through the process of ignoring specific files or folders in your codebase when using Cody. 

## Enabling Unstable Features

To use the ignore context feature, you first need to enable unstable features in Cody. Here's how:

1. Open your settings in Cody Extension
2. Open `settings.json` link in the settings
3. Add a new line: `"cody.unstableFeatures": true`.

This will enable the use of experimental features, including the ignore context feature.

## Using the Ignore Context Feature

To ignore certain files or folders from the context taken by Cody, you need to create a `ignore` file in your project. Here's how:

1. Create a new folder in your project root named `.cody`.
2. Inside the `.cody` folder, create a file named `ignore`.
3. In the `ignore` file, specify the files or folders you want to ignore.

The `.codyignore` file works similarly to a `.gitignore` file. If you want to ignore a file named `secret.json`, you would add `secret.json` to your `.codyignore` file. If you want to ignore a folder named `lib/shared`, you would add `lib/shared/` to your `.codyignore` file.

Once a file or folder is added to the `.codyignore` file, Cody will no longer provide autocomplete suggestions for that file or folder, and it will not show up in your chat results.

Thank you for trying out this experimental feature, and we look forward to your feedback!
