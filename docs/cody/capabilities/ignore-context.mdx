# Manage Cody Context

<p className="subtitle">You can control and manage what context from your codebase is used by Cody. You can do this by using Cody Context Filters.</p>

<Callout type="note">Cody Context Filters is available only for Enterprise users on all supported [clients](/cody/clients).</Callout>

## Context Filters

Admins on the Sourcegraph Enterprise instance can use the Cody Context Filters to determine which repositories Cody can use as the context in its requests to third-party LLMs. You can use Context Filters if you have:

- A valid Cody Enterprise license running on Sourcegraph instance version `>=5.4.0`
- Running the supported Cody client versions: VS Code `>=1.20.0` and JetBrains `>=6.0.0`
- Setting the `cody-context-filters-enabled` feature flag to `true`

Site admins can customize the `cody.contextFilters` field in the site configuration to specify which repositories Cody should `include` or `exclude`, using the following structure:

```json
{
  // Optional. If defined, it must have at least one
  // field set (either `include` or `exclude`).
  "cody.contextFilters": {
    // Optional. If defined, it must have at least one item.
    "include": [
      {
        // Required. Should follow the RE2 syntax.
        "repoNamePattern": "^github\\.com\\/sourcegraph\\/.*"
      }
    ],
    // Optional. If defined, it must have at least one item.
    "exclude": [
      {
        // Required. Should follow the RE2 syntax.
        "repoNamePattern": ".*analytics.*"
      }
    ]
  }
}

```

## How `include` and `exclude` rules work

The `include` and `exclude` rules define the repositories Cody can use as context. The rules can be defined in the following combination:

### `cody.contextFilters` field is not defined

By default, Cody can access all repositories for context when making requests to third-party LLMs, with no restrictions on inclusion or exclusion.

### Only `include` rules are specified

Cody is restricted to using content only from repositories whose names match the patterns specified in the `include` field. No repositories are explicitly excluded if no `exclude` rules are defined.

The `include` field can also contain a catch-all pattern (e.g., a `regexp` that matches any string), allowing Cody to access content from all repositories. A single match in the `include` rules is enough for a repository to be included. For example:

```json
{
  "cody.contextFilters": {
    // Only repositories whose names either start with "github.com/sourcegraph/"
    // or contain "cody" are allowed.
    "include": [
      { "repoNamePattern": "^github\\.com\\/sourcegraph\\/.+" },
      { "repoNamePattern": ".*cody.*" }
    ]
  }
}

```

These `include` rules allow Cody only to utilize the repository matching the `regexp` with full access to fetch context.

### Only `exclude` rules are specified

By default, all repositories are included unless specific `include` rules are defined. If **only** `exclude` rules are specified, Cody will not use content from any repository whose name matches at least one pattern in the `exclude` field.

The `exclude` field can also include a catch-all condition, such as a `regexp` that matches any string. When such a condition is present, Cody is entirely restricted from accessing content from any repository. For example:

```json
{
  "cody.contextFilters": {
    // All repositories are allowed except for "github.com/sourcegraph/cody-analytics"
    // or the ones containing "secret" in their name.
    "exclude": [
      { "repoNamePattern": "^github\\.com\\/sourcegraph\\/cody-analytics$" },
      { "repoNamePattern": ".*secret.*" }
    ]
  }
}

```

#### Chat behavior when exclude rules are defined

Some Cody features, such as using **Prompts**, will not work if the `exclude` rules are defined. They appear to be disabled in the Cody chat interface. If you try running any of these, you'll be prompted with an error message. However, Cody chat will still work; you can use it to ask questions.

### Both `include` and `exclude` rules are specified

When requesting third-party LLMs, Cody can use content from a repository if its name matches any of the `include` patterns and does not match any of the `exclude` patterns. Thus, the `exclude` rules filter only the repositories allowed by the `include` rules. For example,

```json
{
  "cody.contextFilters": {
    // All repositories starting with "github.com/sourcegraph/" are allowed
    "include": [
      { repoNamePattern: "^github\\.com\\/sourcegraph\\/.+" }
    ],
    // except for "github.com/sourcegraph/cody-analytics"
    // and the ones containing "cody" in their name.
    "exclude": [
      { "repoNamePattern": "^github\\.com\\/sourcegraph\\/cody-analytics$" },
      { "repoNamePattern": ".*cody.*" }
    ]
  }
}

```

In this case, Cody can access content from repositories whose names start with `github.com/sourcegraph/`. However, it excludes files from repositories with `cody` in their name.

## Cody Context Filters Compatibility Matrix

<Callout type="info"> Cody Context Filters work only on Sourcegraph versions `>=5.4.0`, VS Code `>=1.20.0` and JetBrains `>=6.0.0` for Enterprise users.</Callout>

Depending on the client type, here's a breakdown of versions supported and the behavior for unsupported versions:

|  **Client**   |      Client version       | Sourcegraph `v<5.4.0` | Sourcegraph `v=5.4.0` |    Sourcegraph `v=5.4.12303`    | Sourcegraph `v>=5.4.0` |
