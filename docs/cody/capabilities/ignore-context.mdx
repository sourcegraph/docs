# Cody Ignore

<p className="subtitle">Learn how to ignore specific files or folders in your codebase when using Cody.</p>

The Cody Ignore feature helps you control what context from your codebase is used by Cody. You can do it via:

-   Cody Context Filters (Cody Enterprise Only)
-   Cody Ignore File (All Cody users)

## Cody Context Filters 
<Callout type="info"> Cody Context Filters is available for Enterprise users and is currently in the Experimental stage.</Callout>
Admins on the Sourcegraph Enterprise instance can use the **Cody Context Filters** to determine which repositories Cody can use as the context in its requests to third-party LLMs. This functionality is currently experimental and is only supported with the following requirements:

- A valid Cody Enterprise license and a running Sourcegraph version `>=5.4.0`
- Works if you're using Cody for VS Code, Cody for JetBrains, and Cody for Web as your client
- Your Cody client meets the following version specs: VS Code `>=1.20.0` and JetBrains `>=6.0.0`
- Setting the `cody-context-filters-enabled` feature flag to `true`

Administrators can configure the `cody.contextFilters` field in the site configuration with the repos that they wish Cody to exclude or only include using the following structure:

```json5
{
	// Optional. If defined, it must have at least one
	// field set (either `include` or `exclude`).
	'cody.contextFilters': {
		// Optional. If defined, it must have at least one item.
		include: [
			{
				// Required. Should follow the RE2 syntax.
				repoNamePattern: '^github\\.com\\/sourcegraph\\/.*'
			}
		],
		// Optional. If defined, it must have at least one item.
		exclude: [
			{
				// Required. Should follow the RE2 syntax.
				repoNamePattern: '.*analytics.*'
			}
		]
	}
}
```

### Interaction between include and exclude rules

1. `cody.contextFilters` field is not defined

By default, there are no restrictions on the repositories Cody can use for context in requests to third-party LLMs. All repositories are included, and none are excluded

    
   

2.  **Only `include` rules are specified**

    Cody is restricted to using content from repositories whose names match any of the specified patterns in the include field.

    Since no exclude rules are specified, no repositories are explicitly excluded.

    Note: An include field might contain a catch-all pattern (e.g., a regexp matching any string). In this scenario,
    Cody can access content from any repository, as a single match in the include rules is sufficient for inclusion.

    Example:

```json5
{
	'cody.contextFilters': {
		// Only repositories whose names either start with 'github.com/sourcegraph/'
		// or contain 'cody' are allowed.
		include: [
			{repoNamePattern: '^github\\.com\\/sourcegraph\\/.+'},
			{repoNamePattern: '.*cody.*'}
		]
	}
}
```

3.  **Only `exclude` rules are specified**

    In the absence of include rules, all repositories are considered included by default.

    Cody is prohibited from using content from any repository whose name matches at least one pattern specified in the exclude field.

    Note: An exclude field may also contain a catch-all condition (e.g., a regexp matching any string).
    If such a match occurs, Cody is restricted from using content from any repository.

Example:

```json5
{
	'cody.contextFilters': {
		// All repositories are allowed except for "github.com/sourcegraph/cody-analytics"
		// or the ones containing "secret" in their name.
		exclude: [
			{repoNamePattern: '^github\\.com\\/sourcegraph\\/cody-analytics$'},
			{repoNamePattern: '.*secret.*'}
		]
	}
}
```

4. **Both `include` and `exclude` rules are specified**

In any requests to third-party LLMs, Cody can use content from a repository if its name matches any of the include patterns
and does not match any of the exclude patterns.

Thus, the exclude rules filter only the repositories allowed by the include rules.

Example:

```json5
{
	'cody.contextFilters': {
		// All repositories starting with "github.com/sourcegraph/" are allowed
		include: [{repoNamePattern: '^github\\.com\\/sourcegraph\\/.+'}],
		// except for "github.com/sourcegraph/cody-analytics"
		// and the ones containing "cody" in their name.
		exclude: [
			{repoNamePattern: '^github\\.com\\/sourcegraph\\/cody-analytics$'},
			{repoNamePattern: '.*cody.*'}
		]
	}
}
```

## Cody Ignore File (All Cody users)

<Callout type="note">
	This feature is currently in the Experimental stage and only supported with
	VS Code extension.
</Callout>

All Cody users can also configure the `.codyignore` file to specify files or folders from your codebase to be ignored as context
by Cody through the following steps:

### Enabling Unstable Features

To use the ignore context feature, you first need to enable unstable features in Cody. Here's how:

1. Open your settings in Cody Extension
2. Next go to the `settings.json` file
3. Add a new line: `"cody.unstableFeatures": true`.

This will enable experimental features, including the ignore context feature.

### Using the Ignore Context Feature

To ignore specific files or folders from the context taken by Cody, you need to create a `ignore` file in your project. Here's how:

1. Create a new folder in your project root named `.cody`.
2. Inside the `.cody` folder, create a file named `ignore`.
3. In the `ignore` file, specify the files or folders you want to ignore.

The `.codyignore` file works similarly to a `.gitignore` file. If you want to ignore a file named `secret.json`, you would add `secret.json` to your `.codyignore` file. If you're going to ignore a folder called `lib/shared`, you would add `lib/shared/` to your `.codyignore` file.

Once a file or folder is added to the `.codyignore` file, Cody will no longer provide autocomplete suggestions for that file or folder, and it will not appear in your chat results.
