## Context Filters

<Callout type="note">Context Filters is available only for Cody Enterprise users.</Callout>

Admins on the Sourcegraph Enterprise instance can use the Cody Context Filters to determine which repositories Cody can use as the context in its requests to third-party LLMs. Cody Context Filters can be used when the following conditions are met:

- A valid Cody Enterprise license running on Sourcegraph instance version `>=5.4.0`
- Running the supported Cody client versions: VS Code `>=1.20.0` and JetBrains `>=6.0.0`
- Setting the `cody-context-filters-enabled` feature flag to `true`

Administrators can configure the `cody.contextFilters` field in the site configuration with the repos that they wish Cody to exclude or only include using the following structure:

```json
{
 // Optional. If defined, it must have at least one
 // field set (either `include` or `exclude`).
 'cody.contextFilters': {
 // Optional. If defined, it must have at least one item.
 include: [
 {
 // Required. Should follow the RE2 syntax.
 repoNamePattern: '^github\\.com\\/sourcegraph\\/.*'
 }
 ],
 // Optional. If defined, it must have at least one item.
 exclude: [
 {
 // Required. Should follow the RE2 syntax.
 repoNamePattern: '.*analytics.*'
 }
 ]
 }
}
```

### How include and exclude rules work

The `include` and `exclude` rules define the repositories Cody can use as context. The rules can be defined in the following combination:

1. `cody.contextFilters` field is not defined

By default, there are no restrictions on the repositories Cody can use for context in requests to third-party LLMs. All repositories are included, and none are excluded.

2. Only `include` rules are specified

Cody is restricted from using content from repositories whose names match any specified patterns in the `include` field. Since no `exclude` rules are specified, no repositories are explicitly excluded. An `include` field might contain a catch-all pattern (e.g., a `regexp` matching any string). In this case, Cody can access content from any repository, as a single match in the `include` rules is sufficient for inclusion. For example,

```json
{
 'cody.contextFilters': {
 // Only repositories whose names either start with 'github.com/sourcegraph/'
 // or contain 'cody' are allowed.
 include: [
 {repoNamePattern: '^github\\.com\\/sourcegraph\\/.+'},
 {repoNamePattern: '.*cody.*'}
 ]
 }
}
```

</video>

The `include` rules allow Cody to access the repository matching the `regexp`. This means Cody can now fully access the repository and its content to fetch context.

3. Only `exclude` rules are specified

All repositories are considered included by default without the `include` rules. Cody is prohibited from using content from any repository whose name matches at least one pattern specified in the exclude field. An `exclude` field may contain a catch-all condition (e.g., a `regexp` matching any string). If such a match occurs, Cody is restricted from using content from any repository. For example,

```json
{
 'cody.contextFilters': {
 // All repositories are allowed except for "github.com/sourcegraph/cody-analytics"
 // or the ones containing "secret" in their name.
 exclude: [
 {repoNamePattern: '^github\\.com\\/sourcegraph\\/cody-analytics$'},
 {repoNamePattern: '.*secret.*'}
 ]
 }
}
```

In this case, Cody's commands are disabled, and you cannot use them for context fetching. If you try running any of these, you'll be prompted with an error message. However, Cody chat will still work, and you can use it to ask questions.

The demo shows what happens when you try to run commands due to the `exclude` rules.

</video>

4. Both `include` and `exclude` rules are specified

When making requests to third-party LLMs, Cody can use content from a repository if its name matches any of the `include` patterns and does not match any of the `exclude` patterns. Thus, the `exclude` rules filter only the repositories allowed by the `include` rules. For example,

```json
{
 'cody.contextFilters': {
 // All repositories starting with "github.com/sourcegraph/" are allowed
 include: [{repoNamePattern: '^github\\.com\\/sourcegraph\\/.+'}],
 // except for "github.com/sourcegraph/cody-analytics"
 // and the ones containing "cody" in their name.
 exclude: [
 {repoNamePattern: '^github\\.com\\/sourcegraph\\/cody-analytics$'},
 {repoNamePattern: '.*cody.*'}
 ]
 }
}
```

In this case, Cody can access content from repositories whose names start with `github.com/sourcegraph/`. However, it excludes files from repositories with `cody` in their name.

## Cody Context Filters Compatibility Matrix

<Callout type="info"> Cody Context Filters work only on Sourcegraph versions >=5.4.0, VS Code `>=1.20.0` and JetBrains `>=6.0.0 for Enterprise users.</Callout>

Depending on the client type, here's a breakdown of versions supported and the behavior for unsupported versions:

|        **Client Versions**        | Sourcegraph `v<5.4.0` | Sourcegraph `v=5.4.0`                           | Sourcegraph `v=5.4.X`                           | Sourcegraph `v>=5.4.0` |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **JetBrains `<= 5.5.9`**          | N/A          | Cody is not compatible | Respects policy and prompts to upgrade | Not affected           |
| **`5.5.10 <= JetBrains < 6.0.0`** | N/A          | Cody is not compatible | Respects policy and prompts to upgrade | Not affected           |
| **JetBrains `>= 6.0.0`**          | N/A          | Respects policy | Respects policy | Not affected |
| **VS Code `< 1.16.X`**            | N/A          | Cody is not compatible | Respects policy and prompts to upgrade | Not affected           |
| **`1.18.0 < VS Code < 1.20.0`**   | N/A          | Cody is not compatible | Respects policy and prompts to upgrade | Not affected           |
| **VS Code `>= 1.20.0`**           | N/A          | Respects policy  | Respects policy   | Not affected           |

## Cody Ignore Files

<Callout type="note">Cody Ignore File functionality is available for Cody Free, Pro users and is currently in the Experimental stage and only supported in the VS Code extension.</Callout>

All Cody users can also configure the `.codyignore` file to specify files or folders from your codebase to be ignored as context by Cody through the following steps:

## Enabling Unstable Features

To use the ignore context feature, you first need to enable unstable features in Cody. Here's how:

1. Open your settings in Cody Extension
2. Next, go to the `settings.json` file
3. Add a new line: `"cody.unstableFeatures": true`.

This will enable experimental features, including the ignore context feature.

## Using the Ignore Context Feature

To ignore specific files or folders from the context Cody took, you need to create an `ignore` file for your project. Here's how:

1. Create a new folder in your project root named `.cody`.
2. Inside the `.cody` folder, create a file named `ignore`.
3. In the `ignore` file, specify the files or folders you want to ignore.

The `.codyignore` file works similarly to a `.gitignore` file. If you want to ignore a file named `secret.json`, you would add `secret.json` to your `.codyignore` file. If you're going to ignore a folder called `lib/shared`, you would add `lib/shared/` to your `.codyignore` file.

Once a file or folder is added to the `.codyignore` file, Cody will no longer provide autocomplete suggestions for that file or folder, and it will not appear in your chat results.
