# OpenCtx Context Providers

<p className="subtitle">Use additional context sources from outside of your code base by leveraging OpenCtx Providers.</p>

## Enable

This feature is available in the Cody VS Code extension. In the Cody Settings, check the box for **OpenCtx: enable**. This will enable OpenCtx. **There is no need to install the OpenCtx extension; Cody comes with OpenCtx built-in.**

## Configuration

OpenCtx Providers are added via your `settings.json` file in VS Code. The configuration looks something like this:

```json
"openctx.providers": {
    // ...other providers...
    "https://openctx.org/npm/@openctx/provider-devdocs": true,
},
```

Please refer to the [context providers documentation](https://openctx.org/) for instructions and examples of configuring other providers such as Confluence, Jira, GitHub, Slack, Notion, Linear Issues, Linear Docs, Google Docs, and more.
