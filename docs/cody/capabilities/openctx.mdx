# OpenCtx Context Providers

<p className="subtitle">Use additional context sources from outside of your codebase by leveraging OpenCtx providers.</p>

<Callout type="tip">MCP is the recommended method for adding external context in Cody due to its broad community adoption and extensive tool support. [Read the docs](/cody/capabilities/agentic-context-fetching#mcp-support) to learn more about configuring MCP.</Callout>

[OpenCtx](https://openctx.org/) is an open standard for bringing contextual info about code into your dev tools. OpenCtx context providers are in the Experimental stage for all Cody users. Enterprise users can use this, but with limited support. Cody Free and Pro users can use OpenCtx providers to fetch and use context from the following sources:

- [Webpages (via URL)](https://openctx.org/docs/providers/web) (enabled in Cody by default)
- [Jira tickets](https://openctx.org/docs/providers/jira)
- [Linear issues](https://openctx.org/docs/providers/linear-issues)
- [Notion pages](https://openctx.org/docs/providers/notion)
- [Google Docs](https://openctx.org/docs/providers/google-docs)
- [Slack](https://openctx.org/docs/providers/slack)
- [Storybook](https://openctx.org/docs/providers/storybook)
- [Sourcegraph code search](https://openctx.org/docs/providers/sourcegraph-search)

## Enable OpenCtx context providers

<Callout type="note">OpenCtx context providers are only supported with Cody VS Code extension.</Callout>

To try OpenCtx context providers with Cody, you must add to your VS Code extension settings. Go to Cody Settings, and check the box for **OpenCtx: Enable**. This will enable OpenCtx. You don't need the OpenCtx VS Code extension to use context fetching with OpenCtx. You should uninstall the extension before using this feature in Cody.

 For example, to use the [DevDocs provider](https://openctx.org/docs/providers/devdocs), add the following to your `settings.json`:

```json
"openctx.providers": {
    "https://openctx.org/npm/@openctx/provider-devdocs": {
        "urls": ["https://devdocs.io/go/", "https://devdocs.io/angular~16/"]
    }
},
```

Please refer to the [context providers docs](https://openctx.org/) for instructions and examples of configuring other providers such as Confluence, Jira, GitHub, Slack, Notion, Linear Issues, Linear Docs, Google Docs, and more.
