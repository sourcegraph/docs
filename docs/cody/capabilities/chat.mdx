# Chat

<p className="subtitle">Chat with Cody in your code editor or via the Sourcegraph web app to get intelligent suggestions, code autocompletions, and contextually aware answers.</p>

 You can **chat** with Cody to ask questions about your code, generate code, and edit code. By default, Cody has the context of your open file and entire repository, and you can use `@` to add context for specific files, symbols, remote repositories, or other non-code artifacts.

You can do it from the **chat** panel of the supported editor extensions ([VS Code](/cody/clients/install-vscode), [JetBrains](/cody/clients/install-jetbrains), [Visual Studio](/cody/clients/install-visual-studio)) or in the [web](/cody/clients/cody-with-sourcegraph) app.

## Prerequisites

To use Cody's chat, you'll need the following:

- A Sourcegraph Enterprise account with Cody enabled
- A supported editor extension installed or use via the Sourcegraph Web app

## How does chat work?

Cody answers questions by searching your codebase and retrieving context relevant to your questions. Cody uses several methods to search for context, including Sourcegraph's native search and keyword search. Finding and using context allows Cody to make informed responses based on your code rather than being limited to general knowledge. When Cody retrieves context to answer a question, it will tell you which code files it reads to generate its response.

Cody can assist you with various use cases, such as:

- Generating an API call: Cody can analyze your API schema to provide context for the code it generates
- Locating a specific component in your codebase: Cody can identify and describe the files where a particular component is defined
- Handling questions that involve multiple files, like understanding data population in a React app: Cody can locate React component definitions, helping you understand how data is passed and where it originates

## Chat features

There are several features that you can use to make your chat experience better. These features may vary depending on the [client](/cody/clients) you are using. You can learn more about the support for these functionalities in the [feature parity reference](/cody/clients/feature-reference#chat).

## Default context

When you start a new Cody chat, the input window opens with a default `@-mention` context chips for the opened file and the current repository.

At any point in time, you can edit these context chips or remove them entirely if you do not want to use these as context. Any chat without a context chip will instruct Cody to use no codebase context. However, you can always provide an alternate `@-mention` file or symbols to let Cody use it as a new context source.

When you have both a repository and files @-mentioned, Cody will search the repository for context while prioritizing the mentioned files.

## Add new context

You can add new custom context by adding `@-mention` context chips to the chat. At any point, you can use `@-mention` a repository, file, line range, or symbol, to ask questions about your codebase. Cody will use this new context to generate contextually relevant code.

## LLM selection

Cody allows you to select the LLM you want to use for your chat, which is optimized for speed versus accuracy. Enterprise users with the new [model configuration](/cody/clients/model-configuration) can use the LLM selection dropdown to choose a chat model.

You can read about these supported LLM models [here](/cody/capabilities/supported-models#chat-and-commands).

## Smart Apply and Execute code suggestions

Cody lets you dynamically insert code from chat into your files with **Smart Apply**. Whenever Cody provides a code suggestion, you can click the **Apply** button. Cody will then analyze your open code file, find where that relevant code should live, and add a diff. For chat messages where Cody provides multiple code suggestions, you can apply each in sequence to go from chat suggestions to written code.

Smart Apply also supports the executing of commands in the terminal. When you ask Cody a question related to terminal commands, you can now execute the suggestion in your terminal by clicking the `Execute` button in the chat window.

### Model used for Smart Apply

To ensure low latency, Cody uses a more targeted Qwen 2.5 Coder model for Smart Apply. This model improves the responsiveness of the Smart Apply feature in both VS Code and JetBrains while preserving edit quality.

Enterprise users on Cody Gateway get this default Qwen 2.5 Coder model for Smart Apply suggestions. Enterprise users not using Cody Gateway get a Claude Sonnet-based model for Smart Apply.

## Chat history

Cody keeps a history of your chat sessions. You can view it by clicking the **History** button in the chat panel. You can **Export** it to a JSON file for later use or click the **Delete all** button to clear the chat history.

## Prompts

Cody offers quick, ready-to-use [prompts](/cody/capabilities/commands) for common actions to write, describe, fix, and smell code. Read more about [prompts](/cody/capabilities/commands) here.

## Ask Cody to write code

Cody chat can also write code for your questions. For example, in VS Code, ask Cody to "write a function that sorts an array in ascending order".

You are provided with code suggestions in the chat window and the following options for using the code.

- The **Copy Code** icon to your clipboard and paste the code suggestion into your code editor
- Insert the code suggestion at the current cursor location by the **Insert Code at Cursor** icon
- The **Save Code to New File** icon to save the code suggestion to a new file in your project

If Cody's answer isn't helpful, you can try asking again with a different context:

- **Public knowledge only**: Cody will not use your own code files as context; itâ€™ll only use knowledge trained into the base model.
- **Current file only**: Re-run the prompt again using the current file as context.
- **Add context**: Provides @-mention context options to improve the response by explicitly including files, symbols, remote repositories, or even web pages (by URL).
