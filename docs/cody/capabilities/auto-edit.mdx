# Auto-edit

<p className="subtitle">Auto-edit suggests code changes by analyzing cursor movements and typing. After you've made at least one character edit in your codebase, it begins proposing contextual modifications based on your cursor position and recent changes.</p>

<Callout type="info">Auto-edit is currently available in VS Code extension in the Experimental stage for all Cody Pro users and Enterprise users on Cody Gateway.</Callout>

## Capabilities of auto-edit

- Can automatically insert and delete text
- Can modify code before and after the cursor position
- Works with repetitive tasks, especially in test files
- Can propose similar changes across multiple locations based on recent edits
- Can handle complex refactoring operations like adding parameters and unpacking functions

## Enabling auto-edit

Eligible Cody Pro users will gradually be given access to the auto-edit feature. Once you have it, you will receive an in-editor notification.

### Auto-edit access for Enterprise customers

Auto-edit is available for Enterprise customers with [Sourcegraph Cody Gateway](/cody/core-concepts/cody-gateway#sourcegraph-cody-gateway) access. Enabling the feature requires two steps:

1. Site administrators must enable the feature flag `cody-autoedit-experiment-enabled-flag`
2. They also need to allow the Fireworks provider as an allowed provider as [suggested here](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody/enterprise/model-configuration#model-filters)
3. Once enabled, developers will receive a notification in their editor to turn it on

## How does auto-edit work?

The system detects potential changes based on the following:

- Cursor placement in the code
- Recent changes made in similar contexts
- Function usage patterns
- Common refactoring patterns

## Auto-edit vs. Autocomplete

In terms of feature-set and functionality, auto-edit and autocomplete have some key differences:

|      **Feature**       |            **Autocomplete**            |                   **Auto-edit**                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Text modification**  | Can only insert text, not delete       | Can both insert and delete text                    |
| **Cursor position**    | Only proposes content after the cursor | Can modify code before and after the cursor        |
| **Suggestion trigger** | Suggests on every character typed      | Proposes changes based on context and recent edits |

## Use cases

The auto-edit feature can help you with various repetitive tasks in your code:

- **Function signature refactoring**: Automatically suggests adding error returns, new parameters, or changing return types across function definitions. For example, when you modify a function to return both a value and an error, auto-edits helps update the function signature.
- **Call site updates**: When you change a function's signature, auto-edit detects all locations where the function is called and suggests necessary modifications to match the new signature. This includes updating parameter orders, adding error handling, and adjusting return value usage.
- **Test file maintenance**: Helps with repetitive updates in test files, such as modifying test assertions, updating mock objects, or changing test data structures. Auto-edits recognizes patterns from your recent changes and suggests similar modifications across related tests.
- **Parameter refactoring**: Assists in adding, removing, or reorganizing function parameters. When you unpack a function to handle more cases, auto-edits helps restructure the parameter list and suggests corresponding changes at call sites.
- **Type system modifications**: When updating type definitions or interfaces, auto-edits identifies and suggests consistent changes across your codebase. This includes updating variable declarations, function parameters, and return types to maintain type consistency.

## Known limitations

- Requires at least one character edit in the codebase before suggestions become active
- May not propose all necessary changes in complex refactoring scenarios, requiring some manual edits
- Suggestions are limited to a fixed number of lines around the cursor
- Sometimes requires manual deletion or cleanup of code
- Suggestions may not cover all similar instances of code that could be changed
