# Auto-edit

<p className="subtitle">Auto-edit suggests code changes by analyzing cursor movements and typing. After you've made at least one character edit in your codebase, it begins proposing contextual modifications based on your cursor position and recent changes.</p>

<Callout type="info">Auto-edit is currently available in VS Code extension in the Experimental stage for all Cody Pro users and Enterprise users on Cody Gateway.</Callout>

## Capabilities of auto-edit

- Can automatically insert and delete text
- Can modify code before and after the cursor position
- Works with repetitive tasks, especially in test files
- Can propose similar changes across multiple locations based on recent edits
- Can handle complex refactoring operations like adding parameters and unpacking functions

## Enabling auto-edit

Eligible Cody Pro users will gradually be given access to the auto-edit feature. Once you have it, you will receive an in-editor notification.

### Auto-edit access for Enterprise customers

Auto-edit is available for Enterprise customers with [Sourcegraph Cody Gateway](/cody/core-concepts/cody-gateway#sourcegraph-cody-gateway) access. Enabling the feature requires two steps:

1. Site administrators must enable the feature flag `cody-autoedit-experiment-enabled-flag`
2. They also need to allow the Fireworks provider as an allowed provider as [suggested here](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody/enterprise/model-configuration#model-filters)
3. Once enabled, developers will receive a notification in their editor to turn it on

## How does auto-edit work?

The system detects potential changes based on the following:

- Cursor placement in the code
- Recent changes made in similar contexts
- Function usage patterns
- Common refactoring patterns

## Auto-edit vs. Autocomplete

In terms of feature-set and functionality, auto-edit and autocomplete have some key differences:

|      **Feature**       |            **Autocomplete**            |                   **Auto-edit**                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Text modification**  | Can only insert text, not delete       | Can both insert and delete text                    |
| **Cursor position**    | Only proposes content after the cursor | Can modify code before and after the cursor        |
| **Suggestion trigger** | Suggests on every character typed      | Proposes changes based on context and recent edits |
| **Scope**              | -                                      | Can do everything autocomplete can do              |

## Use cases

The auto-edit feature can help you with various repetitive tasks in your code:

1. Function signature refactoring (adding error returns)
2. Updating function call sites after signature changes
3. Repetitive modifications in test files
4. Parameter additions and function unpacking
5. Type system updates across multiple locations

## Known limitations

- Requires at least one character edit in the codebase before suggestions become active
- May not propose all necessary changes in complex refactoring scenarios, requiring some manual edits
- Suggestions are limited to a fixed number of lines around the cursor
- Sometimes requires manual deletion or cleanup of code
- Suggestions may not cover all similar instances of code that could be changed
