# Auto-edits

<p className="subtitle">Auto-edits is a feature that suggests changes while you navigate your codebase. It's the next generation of our Autocomplete feature.</p>

<Callout type="info">Auto-edits is currently in the ........</Callout>

## Capabilities of auto-edits

- Can automatically insert and delete text

- Proposes changes by cursor placement without requiring typing

- Can modify code before and after the cursor position

- Can handle complex refactoring operations like adding parameters and unpacking functions

- Works with repetitive tasks, especially in test files

- Can propose similar changes across multiple locations based on recent edits

## Enable auto-edits

**TBD**

### Auto-edits access for Enterprise customers

Configure auto-edits on an Enterprise Sourcegraph instance...

<Callout type="note">Users with admin access can only configure auto-edits settings.</Callout>

**TBD**

It's also recommended to read the [Enabling Cody on Sourcegraph Enterprise](/cody/clients/enable-cody-enterprise) docs.

## How do auto-edits work?

The system detects potential changes based on:

- Cursor placement in the code

- Recent changes made in similar contexts

- Function usage patterns

- Common refactoring patterns

## Auto-edits vs. Autocomplete

Autocomplete:

- Requires typing to trigger suggestions

- Can only insert text, not delete

- Only proposes content after the cursor position

- Suggests on every character typed

Auto-edits:

- Works by cursor placement alone, no typing needed

- Can both insert and delete text

- Can modify code before and after the cursor position

- Proposes changes based on context and recent edits

## Auto-edits use cases

1. Function signature refactoring (adding error returns)

2. Updating function call sites after signature changes

3. Repetitive modifications in test files

4. Parameter additions and function unpacking

5. Type system updates across multiple locations

## Known limitations

- Sometimes doesn't propose all necessary changes

- May require manual deletion in some cases

- Certain changes may need to be applied manually

- Sometimes, auto-edits fail to accept completions when a user has Vim installed and is currently in Vimâ€™s normal mode
