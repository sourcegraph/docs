<Callout type="note">To use Claude 3 Sonnet models with Cody Enterprise, make sure you've upgraded your Sourcegraph instance to the latest version. </Callout>

### CLaude 3.7 Sonnet

Claude 3.7 has two variants — Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude 3.7 Extended Thinking — to support deep reasoning and fast, responsive edit workflows. This means you can use Claude 3.7 in different contexts depending on whether long-form reasoning is required or for tasks where speed and performance are a priority.

Claude 3.7 Extended Thinking version will be the recommended default chat model for Cloud customers. Self-hosted customers are encouraged to follow this recommendation, as Claude 3.7 outperforms 3.5 in most scenarios.

#### Claude 3.7 for GCP

In addition, Sourcegraph Enterprise customers using GCP vertex (Google Cloud Platform) for Claude models can use both these variants of Claude 3.7 to optimize extended reasoning and deeper understanding. Customers using AWS Bedrock doesn't have Claude 3.7 Extended Thinking variant.

<Callout type="info">Claude 3.7 Sonnet with thinking is not supported for BYOK deployments.</Callout>

## Autocomplete

Cody uses a set of models for autocomplete which are suited for the low latency use case.
