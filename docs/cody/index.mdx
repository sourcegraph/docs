# Cody

Cody is an AI coding assistant that uses all the latest LLMs and your development context to help you understand, write, and fix code faster. It uses the powerful Sourcegraph Sourcegraph's advanced Search API to pull context from both local and remote codebases so that you can use context about APIs, symbols, and usage patterns from across your entire codebase.
