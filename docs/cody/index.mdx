Cody is an AI coding assistant that uses all the latest LLMs and your development context to help you understand, write, and fix code faster. It uses the powerful Sourcegraph's advanced Search API to pull context from both local and remote codebases so that you can use context about APIs, symbols, and usage patterns from across your entire codebase.

| **Feature**                                              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **[Chat](/cody/capabilities/chat)**                      | Chat directly with AI to ask questions about your code, generate code, and edit code. Cody has the context of your open file and repository by default, and you can use `@` to add context on specific files, symbols, remote repositories, or other non-code artifacts. |
| **[Auto-edit](/cody/capabilities/auto-edit)**            | Suggests code changes by analyzing cursor movements and typing. After you've made at least one character edit in your codebase, it begins proposing contextual modifications based on your cursor position and recent changes.                                           |
| **[Prompts](/cody/capabilities/commands)**               | Automate key tasks in your workflow with premade and customizable prompts. Any common query or task can be built into a prompt to save and share with your team.                                                                                                         |
| **[Context](/cody/core-concepts/context)**               | Cody provides the best LLM models and context to power chat. It uses the powerful Sourcegraph's advanced Search API to pull context from both local and remote codebases.                                                                                                |
| **[Debug code](/cody/capabilities/debug-code)**          | Cody is optimized to identify and fix errors in your code. Its debugging capability and autocomplete suggestions can significantly accelerate your debugging process, increasing developer productivity.                                                                 |
| **[Context Filters](/cody/capabilities/ignore-context)** | Cody can ignore selected repositories from chat and autocomplete results, which helps you control and manage what context your codebase uses.                                                                                                                            |
