## Setting up Cody Enterprise

You can set up Cody for your Enterprise instance by two methods:

1. Sourcegraph Cloud
2. Self-hosted Sourcegraph

## Cody on Sourcegraph Cloud

With [Sourcegraph Cloud](/cloud/), you get Cody as a managed service, and you **do not** need to enable Cody as is required for self-hosted setup. However, by contacting your account manager, Cody can still be enabled or disabled on-demand on your Sourcegraph instance.

## Self-hosted Sourcegraph Enterprise

### Prerequisites

- You have Sourcegraph version `5.1.0` or more
- A Sourcegraph Enterprise subscription with [Sourcegraph model provider (Cody Gateway)](/model-provider) or an account with a third-party LLM provider

### Enable Cody on your Sourcegraph instance

Site admins can only enable Cody on the Sourcegraph instance. To do so,

- First, configure your desired LLM provider either by [using Sourcegraph model provider (Cody Gateway)](/model-provider) or by directly using a third-party LLM provider
- Next, go to **Site admin > Site configuration** (`/site-admin/configuration`) on your instance and set:

```json
    {
      // [...]
      "cody.enabled": true,
      "completions": {
        "provider": "sourcegraph"
      }
    }
```

- Cody is enabled on your self-hosted Sourcegraph enterprise instance

## Disable Cody

To turn Cody off:

- Go to **Site admin > Site configuration** (`/site-admin/configuration`) on your instance and set:

```json
    {
      // [...]
      "cody.enabled": false
    }
```

## Enable Cody only for some users

How to enable Cody only for _some_ users depends on what version of Sourcegraph you are running.

### Sourcegraph v5.3+

In Sourcegraph v5.3+, access to Cody is managed via user roles. By default, all users have access.

First, ensure Cody is enabled in your site configuration. Go to **Site admin > Site configuration** (`/site-admin/configuration`) on your instance and set:

```json
    {
      // [...]
      "cody.enabled": true,
      // Make sure cody.restrictUsersFeatureFlag is not in your configuration! If it is, remove it.
    }
```

<Callout type="info"> Ensure `cody.restrictUsersFeatureFlag` is **not** in your site configuration. If it is, remove it or else the old feature-flag approach from Sourcegraph 5.2 and earlier will be used.</Callout>

Next, go to **Site admin > Users & Auth > Roles** (`/site-admin/roles`) on your instance. On that page, you can:

- Control whether users **by default** have access to Cody (expand `User [System]` and toggle **Cody** > **Access** as desired)
- Control whether groups of users have access to Cody (`+Create role` and enable the **Cody** > **Access** toggle as desired)

### Sourcegraph v5.2 and earlier

In Sourcegraph v5.2 and earlier, you should use the feature flag `cody` to turn Cody on selectively for some users. To do so:

- Go to **Site admin > Site configuration** (`/site-admin/configuration`) on your instance and set:

```json
    {
      // [...]
      "cody.enabled": true,
      "cody.restrictUsersFeatureFlag": true
    }
```

- Next, go to **Site admin > Feature flags** (`/site-admin/feature-flags`)
- Add a feature flag called `cody`
- Select the `boolean` type and set it to `false`
- Once added, click on the feature flag and use **add overrides** to pick users that will have access to Cody

## Configure Cody for LLM providers

Cody supports several LLM providers and models. You can access these models via the Cody Gateway, directly using your own model provider account or infrastructure.

There are two ways of configuring Cody for LLM providers:
