Cody Free or Pro users can sign in to their Sourcegraph.com accounts. Meanwhile, Sourcegraph Enterprise users should connect Cody via their Enterprise instance URL and the Access Token.

Complete these steps, and you'll be ready to use Cody chat in Eclipse.

## Chat

Cody in Eclipse allows you to ask questions about your code and get contextually aware answers. The chat window is available in a unified interface next to your code. All your previous and existing chats are stored for later use and can be accessed via the **History** icon from the top menu. You can download them to share or use later in a `.json` file or delete them.

The chat input field has a default `@-mention` [context chips](#context-retrieval). These are automatically populated with the names of the files you have open in your editor. There is also a drop-down for [LLM selection](#llm-selection) and a button to run pre-built [prompts](#prompts).

## LLM selection

Cody offers a variety of large language models (LLMs) to power your chat experience. Cody Free users can access the latest base models from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and Mixtral. At the same time, Cody Pro and Enterprise users can access more extended models.

Local models are also available through Ollama to Cody Free and Cody Pro users. To use a model in Cody chat, simply download it and run it in Ollama.

You can read more about it in our [Supported LLM models docs](/cody/capabilities/supported-models).

## Selecting Context with @-mentions

Cody's chat allows you to [add files and symbols as context](/cody/core-concepts/context) in your messages.

- Type `@-file` and then a filename to include a file as a context
- Type `@#` and then a symbol name to include the symbol's definition as context. Functions, methods, classes, types, etc., are all symbols

### Context retrieval

When you start a new Cody chat, the chat input window opens with a default `@-mention` context chips for all the context it intends to use. This context is based on your current repository and current file (or a file selection if you have code highlighted).

At any point in time, you can edit these context chips or remove them completely if you do not want to use these as context. Any chat without a context chip will instruct Cody to use no codebase context. However, you can always provide an alternate `@-mention` file or symbols to let Cody use it as a new context source.

When you have both a repository and files @-mentioned, Cody will search the repository for context while prioritizing the mentioned files.

## Prompts

Cody offers a variety of [pre-built prompts](/cody/capabilities/commands) to help you get the most out of your chat experience. You can access these prompts from the chat input field.
