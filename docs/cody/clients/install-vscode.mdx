## Verifying the installation

Once connected, click the Cody icon from the sidebar again. The Cody extension will open in a configurable side panel.

![cody-sidebar](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/cody-sidebar-0624.png)

Let's create an autocomplete suggestion to verify that the Cody extension has been successfully installed and is working as expected.

Cody provides intelligent code suggestions and context-aware autocompletions for numerous programming languages like JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, Go, etc.

- Create a new file in VS Code, for example, `code.js`
- Next, type the following algorithm function to sort an array of numbers

```js
function bubbleSort(array){

}
```

- As you start typing, Cody will automatically provide suggestions and context-aware completions based on your coding patterns and the code context
- These autocomplete suggestions appear as grayed text. To accept the suggestion, press the `Tab` key

 </video>

## Chat

Cody chat in VS Code is available in a tab next to your code. Once connected to Sourcegraph, a **New Chat** button appears on the bottom left of the Cody sidebar panel. You can have multiple Cody chats going simultaneously in separate tabs.

The chats panel on the left stores all previous and existing chats. You can download them to share or use later in a `.json` file or delete them altogether.

### Chat interface

The chat interface is designed intuitively. Your very first chat input lives at the top of the panel, and the first message in any chat log will stay pinned to the top of the chat. After your first message, the chat input window moves to the bottom of the sidebar.

Since your first message to Cody anchors the conversation, you can return to the top chat box anytime, edit your prompt, or re-run it using a different LLM model.

  <source src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/Media/chat-interface-0624.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

### Chat History

A **Chat History** button at the top of your chat input window allows you to navigate between chats (and search chats) without opening the Cody sidebar.

  style={{ aspectRatio: '1942 / 1086' }}
 />

### Changing LLM model for chat

<Callout type="note"> You need to be a Cody Pro user to have multi-model selection capability. This is not available for Cody Free or Cody Enterprise users.</Callout>

For Chat:

- Open a new chat window (Opt+L/Alt+L)
- Click on the model selector (which by default indicates Claude 3 Sonnet)
- See the selection of models and click the model you desire. This model will now be the default model going forward on any new chats

For Edit:

- On any file, select some code and a right-click
- Select Cody->Edit Code (optionally, you can do this with Opt+K/Alt+K)
- Select the default model available (this is Claude 3 Opus)
- See the selection of models and click the model you desire. This model will now be the default model going forward on any new edits

### Selecting Context with @-mentions

Cody's chat allows you to add files and symbols as context in your messages.

- Type `@-file` and then a filename to include a file as a context
- Type `@#` and then a symbol name to include the symbol's definition as context. Functions, methods, classes, types, etc., are all symbols

The `@-file` also supports line numbers to query the context of large files. You can add ranges of large files to your context by @-mentioning a large file and appending a number range to the filename, for example, `@filepath/filename:1-10`.

When you `@-mention` files to add to Cody’s context window, the file lookup takes `files.exclude`, `search.exclude`, and `.gitgnore` files into account. This makes the file search faster as a result up to 100ms.

Moreover, when you `@-mention` files, Cody will track the number of characters in those files against the context window limit of the selected chat model. As you `@-mention` multiple files, Cody will calculate how many tokens of the context window remain. When the remaining context window size becomes too small, you get **File too large** errors for further more `@-mention` files.

Cody defaults to showing @-mention context chips for all the context it intends to use. When you open a new chat, Cody will show context chips for your current repository and current file (or file selection if you have code highlighted).

### Context retrieval

When you start a new Cody chat, the chat input window opens with a default `@-mention` context chips for all the context it intends to use. This context is based on your current repository and current file (or a file selection if you have code highlighted).

![context-retrieval](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/context-retrieval-0624.png)

At any point in time, you can edit these context chips or remove them completely if you do not want to use these as context. Any chat without a context chip will instruct Cody to use no codebase context. However, you can always provide an alternate `@-mention` file or symbols to let Cody use it as a new source of context.

When you have both a repository and files @-mentioned, Cody will search the repository for context while prioritizing the mentioned files.

  <source src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/Media/context-with-chips-0624.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

### @-mention context providers with OpenCtx

<Callout type="info">OpenCtx context providers is in Experimental stage for all Cody users. Enterprise users can also use this but with limited support. If you have feedback or questions, please visit our [support forum](https://community.sourcegraph.com/c/openctx/10).</Callout>

[OpenCtx](https://openctx.org/) is an open standard for bringing contextual info about code into your dev tools. Cody Free and Pro users can use OpenCtx providers to fetch and use context from the following sources:

- [Webpages](https://openctx.org/docs/providers/web) (via URL)
- [Jira tickets](https://openctx.org/docs/providers/jira)
- [Linear issues](https://openctx.org/docs/providers/linear-issues)
- [Notion pages](https://openctx.org/docs/providers/notion)
- [Google Docs](https://openctx.org/docs/providers/google-docs)
- [Sourcegraph code search](https://openctx.org/docs/providers/sourcegraph-search)

To try it out, add context providers to your VS Code settings. For example, to use the [DevDocs provider](https://openctx.org/docs/providers/devdocs), add the following to your `settings.json`:

```json
"openctx.providers": {
    "https://openctx.org/npm/@openctx/provider-devdocs": {
        "urls": ["https://devdocs.io/go/", "https://devdocs.io/angular~16/"]
    }
},
```

<video width="1920" height="1080" loop playsInline controls style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto', aspectRatio: '1920 / 1080' }}>
  <source src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/Media/openctx-062024.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<Callout type="tip">You don't need the OpenCtx VS Code extension to use context fetching with OpenCtx. We recommend uninstalling the extension before using this feature in Cody.</Callout>

### Rerun prompts with different context

If Cody's answer isn't helpful, you can try asking again with different context:

- Public knowledge only: Cody will not use your own code files as context; it’ll only use knowledge trained into the base model.
- Current file only: Re-run the prompt again using just the current file as context.
- Add context: Provides @-mention context options to improve the response by explicitly including files, symbols, remote repositories, or even web pages (by URL).

  <source src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/Media/rerun-context-0624.mp4" />
</video>

## Context fetching mechanism

VS Code users on the Free or Pro plan use [local context](/cody/core-concepts/context#context-selection).

Enterprise users can use the full power of the Sourcegraph search engine as Cody's primary context provider.

<Callout type="info"> Read more about [Context fetching mechanism](/cody/core-concepts/context/#context-fetching-mechanism) in detail.</Callout>

## Context sources

You can @-mention files, symbols, and web pages in Cody. Cody Enterprise also supports @-mentioning repositories to search for context in a broader scope. Cody's experimental [OpenCtx](https://openctx.org) support adds even more context sources, including Jira, Linear, Google Docs, Notion, and more.

<Callout type="note">Cody Free and Pro offer single-repo context, and Cody Enterprise supports multi-repo context.</Callout>

### Cody Context Filters

<Callout type="note">Context Filters is available for all Cody Enterprise users running Cody VS Code extension version `>=1.20.0`.</Callout>

Admins on the Sourcegraph Enterprise instance can use the Cody Context Filters to determine which repositories Cody can use as the context in its requests to third-party LLMs. Inside your site configuration, you can define a set of `include` and `exclude` rules that will be used to filter the list of repositories Cody can access.

For repos mentioned in the `exclude` field, Cody's commands are disabled, and you cannot use them for context fetching. If you try running any of these, you'll be prompted with an error message. However, Cody chat will still work, and you can use it to ask questions.

## Commands

Cody offers quick, ready-to-use [Commands](/cody/capabilities/commands) for common actions to write, describe, fix, and smell code. These allow you to run predefined actions with smart context-fetching anywhere in the editor, like:

- **New Chat**: Ask Cody a question
- **Document Code**: Add code documentation
- **Edit Code**: Edit code with instructions
- **Explain Code**: Describe your code with more details
- **Find Code Smells**: Identify bad code practices and bugs
- **Generate Unit Tests**: Write tests for your code
- **Custom Commands**: Helps you write and define your own commands

Let's understand how the `/doc` command generates code documentation for a function.

![LLM-models-for-cody-free](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/LLM-Select-Free.png)

Cody Enterprise users get Claude 3 (Opus and Sonnet) as the default LLM models without extra cost. In addition, Enterprise users also get capabilities like BYOLLM (Bring Your Own LLM) key. Your site administrator determines the LLM; you cannot change it from the editor. However, when using Cody Gateway, you can [configure custom models](/cody/core-concepts/cody-gateway#configuring-custom-models) Anthropic (like Claude 2.0 and Claude Instant), OpenAI (GPT 3.5 and GPT 4), Amazon Bedrock and Azure OpenAI Service.

<Callout type="note">To use Claude 3 (Opus and Sonnets) models with Cody Enterprise, make sure you've upgraded your Sourcegraph instance to the latest version.</Callout>

## Supported local Ollama models with Cody

<Callout type="info">Support with Ollama is currently in the Experimental stage and is available for Cody Free and Pro plans.</Callout>

### Cody Autocomplete with Ollama

To get autocomplete suggestions from Ollama locally, follow these steps:

- Install and run [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/)
- Download one of the supported local models:
  - `ollama pull deepseek-coder:6.7b-base-q4_K_M` for [deepseek-coder](https://ollama.ai/library/deepseek-coder)
  - `ollama pull codellama:7b-code` for [codellama](https://ollama.ai/library/codellama)
  - `ollama pull starcoder2:7b` for [codellama](https://ollama.ai/library/starcoder2)
- Update Cody's VS Code settings to use the `experimental-ollama` autocomplete provider and configure the right model:

```json

   {
     "cody.autocomplete.advanced.provider": "experimental-ollama",
     "cody.autocomplete.experimental.ollamaOptions": {
       "url": "http://localhost:11434",
       "model": "deepseek-coder:6.7b-base-q4_K_M"
     }
   }
```

- Confirm Cody uses Ollama by looking at the Cody output channel or the autocomplete trace view (in the command palette)

#### Cody Chat and Commands with Ollama

- Pull the chat model locally (for example, `ollama pull gemma:7b-instruct-q4_K_M`)
- Once the chat model is downloaded successfully, open Cody in VS Code
- Enable the `cody.experimental.ollamaChat` configuration
- Open a new Cody chat
- In the new chat panel, you should see the chat model you've pulled in the dropdown list
- Currently, you will need to restart VS Code to see the new models

<Callout type="note">You can run `ollama list` in your terminal to see what models are currently available on your machine.</Callout>

## Experimental models

<Callout type="info">Support for the following models is currently in the Experimental stage, and available for Cody Free and Pro plans.</Callout>

The following experimental model providers can be configured in Cody's extension settings JSON:

- Google (requires [Google AI Studio API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey))
- Groq (requires [GroqCloud API key](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-keys))
- OpenAI & OpenAI-Compatible API (requires [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))
- Ollama (remote)

Once configured, and VS Code has been restarted, you can select the configured model from the dropdown both for chat and for edits.

Example VS Code user settings JSON configuration:

```json
{
  "cody.dev.models": [
    // Google (e.g. Gemini 1.5 Pro)
    {
      "provider": "google",
      "model": "gemini-1.5-pro-latest",
      "tokens": 1000000,
      "apiKey": "xyz"
    },
    // Groq (e.g. llama2 70b)
    {
      "provider": "groq",
      "model": "llama2-70b-4096",
      "tokens": 4096,
      "apiKey": "xyz"
    },
    // OpenAI & OpenAI-compatible APIs
    {
      "provider": "groq", // keep groq as provider
      "model": "some-model-id",
      "apiKey": "xyz",
      "apiEndpoint": "https://host.domain/path"
    },
    // Ollama (remote)
    {
      "provider": "ollama",
