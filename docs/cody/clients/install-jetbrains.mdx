## Install the JetBrains IntelliJ Cody extension

Follow these steps to install the Cody plugin:

- Type and search **Sourcegraph Cody + Code Search** extension and click **Install**

Alternatively, you can [Download and install the extension from the Jetbrains marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9682-sourcegraph).

## Connect the extension to Sourcegraph

After a successful installation, Cody's icon appears in the sidebar. Clicking it prompts you to start with codehosts like GitHub, GitLab, and your Google login. This allows Cody to access your Sourcegraph.com account.

Alternatively, you can also click the **Sign in with an Enterprise Instance** to connect to your enterprise instance.

![cody-for-intellij-login](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/Media/sign-in-cody-jb.png)

### For Sourcegraph Enterprise users

To connect the extension with your Enterprise instance,

- Log in to your Sourcegraph instance
- Go to **Settings > Access tokens** (`https://<your-instance>.sourcegraph.com/users/<your-username>/settings/tokens`)
- From here, click **Generate new token**
- Next, go back to **Cody Settings...** in the IntelliJ editor
- Click the plus icon (+) under **Authentication** and then select **Log In with Token to Sourcegraph Enterprise**
- Finally, paste your newly created access token and instance URL in the respective fields and click **Add Account** to complete the process

### For Sourcegraph.com users

Alternatively, you can click `Log In to Sourcegraph` to authenticate the IntelliJ extension with your Sourcegraph.com account.

## Verifying the installation

Once Cody is connected successfully to your Sourcegraph instance, click the Cody icon from the sidebar again, and a panel will open. To verify that the Cody extension has been successfully installed and is working as expected, let's create an autocomplete suggestion.

Cody provides intelligent code suggestions and context-aware autocompletions for numerous programming languages like JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, Go, etc.

- Create a new file in IntelliJ, for example, `code.js`
- Next, type the following algorithm function to sort an array of numbers

```js
function bubbleSort(array)
```

- As you start typing, Cody will automatically provide suggestions and context-aware completions based on your coding patterns and the code context
- These autocomplete suggestions appear as grayed text. To accept the suggestion, press the `Tab` key

</video>

## Autocomplete

Autocomplete suggestions appear as inlay suggestions and are enabled by default in your JetBrains IntelliJ editor. With this setting, there is a list of programming languages supported and enabled by default.

To manually configure the Autocomplete feature,

- Go to the **Cody Settings...** from the Cody icon in the sidebar
- Next, click the **Sourcegraph & Cody** dropdown and select **Cody**
- The **Autocomplete** settings will appear with the list of **Enabled Languages**

In addition, Autocomplete suggestions use the same color as inline parameter hints according to your configured editor theme. However, you can optionally enable the **Custom color for completions** checkbox to customize the color of your choice.

## Commands

Cody with JetBrains offers quick, ready-to-use Commands for common actions to write, describe, fix, and smell code. These allow you to run predefined actions with smart context-fetching anywhere in the editor, like:

- Explain Selected Code
- Generate Unit Test
- Smell Code

## LLM Selection

You get a choice of LLM selection with Cody chat in JetBrains. Cody Free users get chat responses supported by Claude 2.0. Cody Pro users can choose the LLM from a drop-down list they'd like Cody to use for chats. For Enterprise users, the administrator determines the LLM, and cannot be changed within the editor.

## Chat history

Next to the chat tab, there is a chat history tab that displays all the previous chat interactions with Cody. You can revisit any of the previous chat interactions to get the context of the conversation.

## Context fetching mechanism

JetBrains users on the Free or Pro plan can leverage [local search](/cody/core-concepts/context#context-selection) as the primary context source for Cody chat. Local or remote embeddings will no longer be produced or used as a context source.

Enterprise users can leverage the full power of the Sourcegraph search engine as the primary context provider to Cody.

<Callout type="info"> Read more about [Context fetching mechanism](/cody/core-concepts/context/#context-fetching-mechanism) in detail.</Callout>

## Context scope

JetBrains users on the Free or Pro plan get single-repo support in chat and can use one repo for context fetching. Enterprise users get multi-repo support in chat and can explicitly specify **up to 10 additional repos** they would like Cody to use for context.

## Context Selection

Cody automatically understands your codebase context based on the project opened in your workspace. However, you can override the automatic codebase detection at any point by enabling the **Chat Context** checkbox. This provides enhanced context selection powered by local search and allows Cody to use the selected codebase to answer your questions.

## Updating the extension

JetBrains IntelliJ will typically notify you when updates are available for installed extensions. Follow the prompts to update the Cody extension to the latest version.
