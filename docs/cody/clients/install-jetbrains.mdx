-   Search for **Cody: AI Coding Assistant with Autocomplete & Chat** in the marketplace and click **Install**

![cody-for-intellij](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/cody-for-intellij-062024.png)

Alternatively, you can also [download and install the plugin from the JetBrains marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9682-sourcegraph) directly.

## Connect the plugin to Sourcegraph

After a successful installation, the Cody icon appears in the Tool Windows Bar.

Sourcegraph Enterprise users should connect Cody to their Enterprise instance by clicking **Sign in with an Enterprise Instance**.

To connect the plugin with your Enterprise instance,

-   Click **Sign in with an Enterprise Instance**
-   Enter the URL of your Enterprise instance. If you are unsure, please get in touch with your administrator
-   Select **Authorize in Browser**. You'll be directed to an authorization page on your instance in the browser

Alternatively, you can access advanced authorization settings by clicking **Show Advanced**. You can manually enter a token generated from your User Settings in your Sourcegraph Enterprise instance or add optional custom request headers.

## Verifying the installation

Once connected, click the Cody icon from the sidebar again. The Cody plugin will open in a configurable side panel.

Let's create an autocomplete suggestion to verify that the Cody plugin has been installed and works as expected.

Cody provides intelligent code suggestions and context-aware autocompletion for numerous programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, Go, etc.

-   Create a new file in your JetBrains IDE, for example, `code.js`
-   Next, type the following algorithm function to sort an array of numbers

```js
function bubbleSort(array) {}
```

-   As you start typing, Cody will automatically provide suggestions and context-aware completions based on your coding patterns and the code context
-   These autocomplete suggestions appear as grayed text. To accept the suggestion, press the `Tab` key

## Chat

Cody chat in JetBrains is available in a unified interface that opens right next to your code. Once connected to Sourcegraph, a new chat input field opens with the default `@-mention` [context chips](#context-retrieval).

All your previous and existing chats are stored for later use and can be accessed via the **History** icon from the top menu. You can download them to share or use later in a `.json` file or delete them.

### Chat interface

The chat interface is designed intuitively. Your very first chat input lives at the top of the panel, and the first message in any chat log will stay pinned to the top of the chat. After your first message, the chat input window moves to the bottom of the sidebar.

Since your first message to Cody anchors the conversation, you can return to the top chat box anytime, edit your prompt, or rerun it using a different LLM model.

![chat-interface](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/jb-chat-interface-2025.png)

<Callout type="info">
	{' '}
	Users must be on JetBrains v2023.2 and Cody plugin v7.0.0 or above to get the
	new and improved chat UI.
</Callout>

### Changing LLM model for chat

<Callout type="note">
	You can view which LLMs you can access on our [supported LLMs
	page](/cody/capabilities/supported-models). Enterprise users with the new
	[model configuration](/cody/enterprise/model-configuration) can use the LLM
	selection dropdown to choose a chat model.
</Callout>

For Chat:

-   Open chat or toggle between editor and chat
-   Click on the model selector (which by default indicates Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
-   See the selection of models and click the model you desire. This model will now be the default model for any new chats

For Edit:

-   On any file, select some code and right-click
-   Select **Cody > Edit Code** (optionally, you can do this with `Opt+K`/`Alt+K`)
-   Select the default model available
-   See the selection of models and click the model you desire. This model will now be the default model for any new edits

### Selecting context with @-mentions

Cody's chat allows you to add files as context in your messages.

-   Type `@-file` and then a filename to include a file as a context.

The `@-file` also supports line numbers to query the context of large files. You can add ranges of large files to your context by @-mentioning a large file and appending a number range to the filename, for example, `@filepath/filename:1-10`.

When you `@-mention` files to add to Cody’s context window, the file lookup takes `files.exclude`, `search.exclude`, and `.gitgnore` files into account. This makes the file search faster as a result up to 100ms.

Moreover, when you `@-mention` files, Cody will track the number of characters in those files against the context window limit of the selected chat model. As you `@-mention` multiple files, Cody will calculate how many tokens of the context window remain. When the remaining context window size becomes too small, you'll receive **File too large** errors when attempting to `@-mention` additional files.

You can read more about context limits when selecting context [here](/cody/core-concepts/token-limits).

### Context retrieval

When you start a new Cody chat, the input window opens with default `@-mention` context chips for all the context it intends to use. This context is based on your current repository and current file (or a file selection if you have code highlighted).

![jb-context-retrieval](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/jb-context-retrieval-2025.png)

At any point in time, you can edit these context chips, add additional context chips, or remove them completely if you do not want to use these as context. Any chat without a context chip will instruct Cody to use no codebase context. However, you can always provide an alternate `@-mention` file to let Cody use it as a new context source.

When you have both a repository and files @-mentioned, Cody will search the repository for context while prioritizing the mentioned files.

### Rerun prompts with different context

If Cody's answer isn't helpful, you can try asking again with a different context:

-   **Public knowledge only**: Cody will not use your code files as context; it’ll only use knowledge trained into the base model.
-   **Current file only**: Rerun the prompt using just the current file as context.
-   **Add context**: Provides @-mention context options to improve the response by explicitly including files, remote repositories, or web pages (URL).

![jb-rerun-context](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/jb-rerun-context-2025.png)

## Context fetching mechanism and sources

Enterprise users can leverage the full power of the Sourcegraph search engine as Cody's primary context provider.

<Callout type="info">
	{' '}
	Read more about [Context fetching mechanisms](/cody/core-concepts/context/#context-fetching-mechanism)
	in detail.
</Callout>

You can @-mention files and web pages in Cody. Cody Enterprise also supports @-mentioning multi-repo context to search in a broader scope.

### Cody Context Filters

<Callout type="note">
	Context Filters is available for all Cody Enterprise users running Cody
	JetBrains plugin version `>=6.0.0`.
</Callout>

Admins on the Sourcegraph Enterprise instance can use Cody Context Filters to determine which repositories Cody can use as the context in its requests to third-party LLMs. Inside your site configuration, you can define a set of `include` and `exclude` rules that will be used to filter the list of repositories Cody can access.

For repos mentioned in the `exclude` field, Cody prompts are disabled, and you cannot use them for context fetching. If you try running any of these, you'll be prompted with an error message. However, Cody chat will still work, and you can use it to ask questions.

[Read more about Cody Context Filters here →](/cody/capabilities/ignore-context)

## Prompts

Cody allows you create quick, ready-to-use [prompts](/cody/capabilities/prompts) to automate key tasks in your workflow. Prompts are created and saved in the Prompt Library and can be accessed from the **Tools > Prompt Library** in the top navigation bar in your Sourcegraph instance.

To help you get started, there are a few prompts that are available by default. These can assist you to:

-   Document code
-   Explain code
-   Detect code smells
-   Generate unit tests

![jb-default-prompts](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/jb-default-prompts-2025.png)

## Smart Apply code suggestions

Cody lets you dynamically insert code from chat into your files with **Smart Apply**. Every time Cody provides you with a code suggestion, you can click the **Apply** button. Cody will then analyze your open code file, find where that relevant code should live, and add a diff. For chat messages where Cody provides multiple code suggestions, you can apply each in sequence to go from chat suggestions to written code.

Smart Apply also supports executing commands in the terminal. When you ask Cody a question related to terminal commands, you can execute the suggestion in your terminal by clicking the `Execute` button in the chat window.

![smart-apply-execute](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/smart-apply-2025.png)

### Inline code edits

You can directly perform inline edits on your code without opening the chat window.

-   Select the code you want to edit
-   Then right-click and select **Cody > Edit Code**
-   Alternatively, you can press Opt+K (macOS) or Alt+K (Windows) to open the inline editor

Here, you can describe the change you want to make and select the LLM model you want to use.

Once you enter your prompt, Cody will perform inline edits that you can **Accept**, **Undo**, or **Show diff** for the change. Click **Edit & Retry** to iterate your prompt and get alternate suggestions.

![jb-inline-code-edit](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/jb-inline-edits-2025.png)

### Inline code fix

Cody with JetBrains can also propose fixes and updates to errors in your code. The inline **Ask Cody to Fix** functionality alerts a user when it notices an issue. It provides a workflow to suggest a fix, review the suggestion, and accept the change, all within the editor.

All you need to do is select and highlight the code line with the error and click the lightbulb icon. Then select **Ask Cody to Fix**. You can then view the diff and accept or undo the suggested change.

## Supported LLM models

Enterprise users who have [model configuration](/cody/enterprise/model-configuration#model-configuration) configured can also select from the available models for their instance. On instances with the ["completions" configuration](/cody/enterprise/model-configuration#completions-configuration), a site admin determines the LLM, which cannot be changed within the editor.
