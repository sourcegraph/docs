# Cody for Web

<p className="subtitle">Learn how to use Cody in the web interface with your Sourcegraph.com instance.</p>

<Callout type="info"> The new chat UI for Cody for web is currently in Beta and is available to users on Sourcegraph versions >=5.5.</Callout>

In addition to the Cody extensions for [VS Code](/cody/clients/install-vscode), [JetBrains](/cody/clients/install-jetbrains) IDEs, and [Neovim](/cody/clients/install-neovim), Cody is also available in the Sourcegraph web app. Community users can use Cody for free by logging into their accounts on Sourcegraph.com, and enterprise users can use Cody within their Sourcegraph instance.

## Initial setup

Create a [Sourcegraph.com account](https://sourcegraph.com/sign-up) by logging in through codehosts like GitHub and GitLab or via traditional Google sign-in. This takes you to Sourcegraph’s web interface. From here, there are two ways to access the Cody chat:

1. Run any search query via **Code Search** and click the **Cody** button on the left to open the chat window
2. Directly click the **Cody** tab from the top header to open the chat interface

Enterprise users can also log in to their Sourcegraph.com Enterprise instance and use Cody in the web interface.

## Chat Interface

The chat interface for Cody on the web is similar to the one you get with the [VS Code](/cody/clients/install-vscode#chat) editor extension. If you click the Cody chat from the top header, you will see a **Start new chat +** button in the bottom left sidebar with the chat editor. All your previous chats appear in this left sidebar. To delete any chat, hover over the chat and click the **Delete** icon.

The chat interface with your Code Search queries is operated per chat. You cannot run multiple chats and store them in parallel. A new chat window opens whenever you click the Cody button from the query editor or the top header.

## LLM Selection

Sourcegraph.com users with Cody **Free** and **Pro** can choose from a list of supported LLM models for a chat. Claude Sonnet 3 is the default LLM model, but users can select the LLM of their choice from the drop-down menu.

Users on an Enterprise Sourcegraph instance do not have the option to choose an LLM model. Their site admin will configure the default LLM model for chat.

## Selecting Context with @-mentions

Cody chat with a Sourcegraph.com instance allows you to add files and symbols as context in your messages.

- Type `@file` and then a filename to include a file as a context
- Type `@` and you can also add **Symbols**, **Files**, and **Repositories** as context

### Context retrieval

When you start a new Cody chat inside the search query window, the chat input window opens with a default `@-mention` context chip for all the context it intends to use. This context is based on your current repository and current file.

At any point in time, you can edit these context chips or remove them completely if you do not want to use these as context. Any chat without a context chip will instruct Cody to use no codebase context. However, you can always provide an alternate `@-mention` file or symbols to let Cody use it as a new context source.

When you have both a repository and files @-mentioned, Cody will search the repository for context while prioritizing the mentioned files.

<Callout type="info">Using your own [custom OpenCtx providers](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody/capabilities/openctx) will not be supported with chat on Cody for Web.</Callout>

### Rerun prompts with different context

If Cody's answer isn't helpful, you can try asking again with a different context:

- **Public knowledge only**: Cody will not use your own code files as context; it’ll only use knowledge trained into the base model
- **Add context**: Provides @-mention context options to improve the response by explicitly including files, symbols, and remote repositories

## Commands

Commands and Custom Commands are not supported in Cody for Web. If you want to run these, it's recommended that you use Cody with the IDE editor extensions (VS Code and JetBrains). However, the plain **Explain** command would work if you type `@mention explain this code` in the chat window.
