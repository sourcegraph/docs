## Prerequisites

- You have Node.js `v20` or newer installed
- You have `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, or an equivalent package manager installed

## Install CLI from npm

Run the following command to install the Cody CLI:
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
```shell
npm install -g @sourcegraph/cody
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="yarn">
```shell
yarn global add @sourcegraph/cody
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm install -g @sourcegraph/cody
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Confirm that the installation was successful by running the following command:

```shell
cody help
```



## Authenticate with cody auth login

To start using the Cody CLI, you need to authenticate it with your Sourcegraph account.

When using `cody auth login`, the access token is stored in the secure storage of your operating system or equivalent security tool.
If you prefer not to let Cody store your access token, authenticate with [environment variables](#authenticate-with-only-environment-variables) instead.

First, make sure you have installed the necessary tools to use `cody auth login`.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
The pre-installed `security` tool is used. No additional installation is required.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
The [CredentialManager](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/CredentialManager/2.0) PowerShell module is required.
Open a PowerShell terminal with administrator privileges and run the following command:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name CredentialManager
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux (Ubuntu)">
The [`secret-tool`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man1/secret-tool.1.html#:~:text=secret%2Dtool%20is%20a%20command,of%20attribute%20keys%20and%20values) command-line tool is used. Run the following commands to install it:
```shell
sudo apt install libsecret-tools
sudo apt install gnome-keyring
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Run the following command to authenticate the Cody CLI:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Browser (fastest)">
```shell
cody auth login --web
```
This will open a browser window where you can authenticate with your Sourcegraph account.
Close the browser tab after authentication is complete.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Command Line">
- For Cody Pro/Free accounts, create an access token at https://sourcegraph.com/user/settings/tokens.
- For Cody Enterprise accounts, sign into your Sourcegraph Enterprise account and create an access token under `Account > Settings > Access Tokens`.
```shell
export SRC_ENDPOINT=ENDPOINT
export SRC_ACCESS_TOKEN=ACCESS_TOKEN
cody auth login # stores the access token securely
```
<Callout type="info">You don't need to export `SRC_ENDPOINT` or `SRC_ACCESS_TOKEN` after running `cody auth login`.
Subsequent command invocation will use the stored access token.</Callout>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Confirm that the authentication was successful by running the following command:

```shell
cody auth whoami
# âœ” Authenticated as USERNAME on ENDPOINT
```

## Authenticate with only environment variables

**Skip this step if you have already authenticated with the `cody auth login` command.**


If you prefer not to let Cody CLI store your access token, you can also pass the endpoint URL and access token through the environment variables `SRC_ENDPOINT` and `SRC_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS/Linux">
```shell
export SRC_ENDPOINT=ENDPOINT
export SRC_ACCESS_TOKEN=ACCESS_TOKEN
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
```powershell
$env:SRC_ENDPOINT = "ENDPOINT"
$env:SRC_ACCESS_TOKEN = "ACCESS_TOKEN"
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

It's recommended to store these access tokens in a secure location. 
For example, you can store them with a password manager like [1Password](https://1password.com/) or [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/).

It is not recommended to export these variables in your shell startup script because it will expose your access token to all commands you run from the terminal. Instead, consider sourcing these environment variables on-demand when you need to authenticate with the Cody CLI.

## Sign out with cody auth logout

To sign out of the Cody CLI, run the following command:

```shell
cody auth logout
```

Running this command wil remove the access token from the secure storage of your operating system.

Run `cody auth whoami` to confirm that the Cody CLI is no longer authenticated.

## Chat with basic message

Once you've authenticated the Cody CLI, you can start using it to chat with Cody.

To start a new chat, run the following command:

```shell
cody chat -m 'Explain React hooks'
```

The following commands are equivalent to the above:

```shell
# use --message instead of -m
cody chat --message 'Explain React hooks'

# space separated arguments
cody chat Explain React hooks
```

## Chat with --context-file to add context from local files

Use `--context-file` to provide context from local files

```shell
cody chat --context-file src/controller.ts -m 'Are there code smells in this file?'
```

## Chat with --context-repo to add context from remote repositories

<Callout type="info">This feature is only supported on Cody Enterprise.</Callout>

Use `--context-repo` to provide context from remote repositories.

```shell
cody chat --context-repo github.com/sourcegraph/cody -m 'What is the agent?'
```

## Chat with --stdin to read message from standard input

Use `--stdin` to provide context from standard input


```shell
echo 'Explain React hooks' | cody chat --stdin
```

Combine `--stdin` with `--message` to send a concatenated message. The
`--message` string appears at the top of the prompt and the `--stdin` text
appears at the bottom.

```shell
git diff | cody chat --stdin -m 'Write a commit message for this diff'
```

Use the `-` trailing argument as an alternative to `--stdin` to read the diff from standard input.

```shell
git diff | cody chat -m 'Write a commit message for this diff' -
```
