## Prerequisites

-   `nvim 0.9 or nvim nightly` version of <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim" target="_blank">Neovim</a> installed
-   `Node.js >= 18.17.0 (LTS)` at runtime for [cody-agent.js](https://github.com/sourcegraph/cody)
-   You have enabled an instance for [Cody from your Sourcegraph.com](/cody/clients/cody-with-sourcegraph) account

## Installation

`sg.nvim` is a plugin that uses Sourcegraph's code intelligence features directly within the Neovim text editor. You can install the plugin using different Neovim plugin managers like:

### `lazy.nvim`

```lua
return {
  {
    "sourcegraph/sg.nvim",
    dependencies = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" },

    -- If you have a recent version of lazy.nvim, you don't need to add this!
    build = "nvim -l build/init.lua",
  },
}
```

### `packer.nvim`

```lua
-- Packer.nvim, also make sure to install nvim-lua/plenary.nvim
use { 'sourcegraph/sg.nvim', run = 'nvim -l build/init.lua' }
```

### `vim-plug`

```lua
-- Using vim-plug
Plug 'sourcegraph/sg.nvim', { 'do': 'nvim -l build/init.lua' }
```

Once you have installed the plugin, run `:checkhealth sg` to verify a successful installation. Next, you are prompted to log in as a free user by connecting to your Sourcegraph.com account or using the enterprise instance.

## Setting up with Sourcegraph instance

To connect `sg.nvim` with Sourcegraph, you need to follow these steps:

-   Log in on your Sourcegraph instance
-   Go to **Settings > Access tokens** from the top right corner
-   Create your access token, and then run `:SourcegraphLogin` in your neovim editor after installation
-   Type in the link to your Sourcegraph instance (for example, https://sourcegraph.com)
-   Next, paste your generated access token

An alternative way to this is to use the environment variables specified for [`src-cli`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli#log-into-your-sourcegraph-instance).

At any point, you can run `:checkhealth sg` to ensure you're logged in and connected to your Sourcegraph instance.
