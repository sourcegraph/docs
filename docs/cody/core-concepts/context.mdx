# Cody Context

        <p className="subtitle">Understand how context helps Cody write more accurate code.</p>

Context refers to any additional information provided to help Cody understand and write code relevant to your codebase. While LLMs have extensive knowledge, they lack context about an individual or organization's codebase. Cody's ability to provide context-aware code responses is what sets it apart.

## Why is context important?

Context awareness is the key to Cody's ability to deliver high-quality responses to users. When Cody has access to the most relevant context about your codebase, it can:

- Answer questions about your codebase
- Produce unit tests and documentation
- Generate code that aligns with the libraries and style of your codebase
- Significantly reduce your work that's required to translate LLM-provided answers into actionable value for your users

## Context Selection

Cody employs various methods to gather context relevant to user input, ensuring the quality of the information provided. These methods include:

- **Local Context**: Cody examines currently open or recently accessed files in the code editor, aiming to offer information based on the user's recent work
- **Keyword Search**: A traditional text search approach that finds keywords matching user input in local code. This method is used when a codebase lacks embeddings
- **Code Search**: Cody utilizes Sourcegraph's Code Search for extensive searches, accessing non-local code repositories using an indexed trigram search
- **Code Graph**: Analyzing the structure of the code, Cody examines how components are interconnected and used, finding context based on code elements' relationships
- **Embeddings**: Cody uses pre-calculated embeddings with a Language Model to find semantically related chunks of code in the user's codebase

All these methods collectively ensure Cody's ability to provide relevant and high-quality context to enhance your coding experience.

## How does context work with Cody prompts?

Cody works in conjunction with an LLM to provide codebase-aware answers. The LLM is a machine learning model that generates text in response to natural language prompts. However, the LLM doesn't inherently understand your codebase or specific coding requirements. Cody bridges this gap by generating context-aware prompts.

A typical prompt has three parts:

- **Prefix**: An optional description of the desired output, often derived from predefined [Commands](/cody/capabilities/commands) that specify tasks the LLM can perform
- **User input**: The information provided, including your code query or request
- **Context**: Additional information that helps the LLM provide a relevant answer based on your specific codebase

For example, Cody's `/explain` code command receives a prompt like this:

- **Prefix**: Explain the following Go code at a high level. Only include details that are essential to an overall understanding of what's happening in the code
- **User input**: `zoekt.QueryToZoektQuery(b.query, b.resultTypes, b.features, typ)`
- **Context**: Contents of `sourcegraph/sourcegraph/internal/search/zoekt/query.go`

### Impact of context LLM vs Cody

When the same prompt is sent to a standard LLM, the response may lack specifics about your codebase. In contrast, Cody augments the prompt with context from relevant code snippets, making the answer far more specific to your codebase. This difference underscores the importance of context in Cody's functionality.

## Usage and Limits

Cody's usage and limits policies help optimize its performance and ensure cost-effectiveness. This section provides insights into the context window size, token limits for chat, commands, and completions, and administrators' control over these settings.

### Cody context window size

Cody's context window represents the amount of contextual information provided to assist in generating code or responses. Currently, the context window size for both chat and commands is set to **7000 tokens per interaction**.

While Cody aims to provide maximum context for each prompt, there are limits to ensure efficiency. Cody shares all relevant context for chat but limits it to **12 code results** and **3 text results** to maintain performance. Each result comprises approximately **250 tokens**.

### Manage context window size

Site administrators can update the maximum context window size to meet their specific requirements. While using fewer tokens is a cost-saving solution, it can also cause errors. For example, using the `/edit` command with few tokens might get you errors like `You've selected too much code`.

Using more tokens usually produces high-quality responses. It's recommended not to modify the token limit. However, if needed, you can set the value to a limit that does not comprise quality and generates errors.
