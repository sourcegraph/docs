Keyword search is the traditional approach to text search. It splits content into terms and builds a mapping from terms to documents. At query time, it extracts terms from the query and uses the mapping to retrieve your documents.

Both Cody chat and completions use Keyword Search. It comes out of the box without any additional setup. Cody with Keyword Search searches your [local VS Code workspace](/cody/core-concepts/local-indexing) and is a cost-effective and time-saving solution.

For an enterprise admin who has set up Cody with a Code Search instance, developers on their local machines can seamlessly access it.
