# Embeddings

<p className="subtitle">Learn how you can use embeddings with Cody for better code understanding.</p>

<Callout type="info">Embeddings are no longer supported on Cody Free, Pro or Enterprise.</Callout>

## What are embeddings?

Embeddings are a semantic representation of text that allows you to create a search index over your codebase. Cody splits your codebase into searchable chunks and sends them to an external service specified in your site's configuration for embedding. The resulting embedding index is stored in your local hard drive.

## Embeddings in VS Code

<Callout type= "info">As of Sourcegraph version 5.3, embeddings are only available to Cody Free and Cody Pro users on the VS Code extension.</Callout>

Cody Free and Pro users can leverage local embeddings for context fetching. Embeddings are created automatically and are used to provide context to Cody in chat, edits, and more.
