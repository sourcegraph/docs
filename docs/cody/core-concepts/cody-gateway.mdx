# Sourcegraph Cody Gateway

<p className="subtitle">Learn how Cody Gateway powers the default Sourcegraph provider for completions, enabling Cody features for Sourcegraph Enterprise customers.</p>

<Callout type="note" title="Note">Cody Gateway is available for Sourcegraph Enterprise customers using version 5.1 or more.</Callout>

Cody Gateway powers the default `"provider": "sourcegraph"` and Cody completions for Sourcegraph Enterprise users. It integrates with various upstream LLM providers, including [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), with rate limits, quotas, and model availability tied to your Sourcegraph Enterprise subscription.

## Supported Models

For a full list of supported models and providers, read our [Supported LLMs](/cody/capabilities/supported-models) docs.

## Setting up Cody Gateway in Sourcegraph Enterprise

To enable completions provided by Cody Gateway on your Sourcegraph Enterprise instance, make sure your license key is set and Cody is enabled in your [site configuration](/admin/config/site_config):

```jsonc
{
  "licenseKey": "<...>",
  "cody.enabled": true,
  "completions": {
    "provider": "sourcegraph"
  }
}
```

Once the license key is added, default configuration and authentication are automatically applied.

For more details about configuring Cody, it's recommended to read about [Enabling Cody for Sourcegraph Enterprise](/cody/clients/enable-cody-enterprise).

Cody Gateway is hosted at `cody-gateway.sourcegraph.com`. To use Cody Gateway, your Sourcegraph instance must be connected to the service in this domain.

<Callout type="warning">Sourcegraph Cody Gateway access must be included in your Sourcegraph Enterprise subscription. You can verify it by checking it with your account manager. If you are a [Sourcegraph Cloud](/cloud/) user, Cody is enabled by default on your instance starting with Sourcegraph 5.1.</Callout>

## Rate limits and quotas

Rate limits, quotas, and model availability are tied to your Sourcegraph Enterprise license for Sourcegraph Enterprise instances.

All successful requests to Cody Gateway will count toward your rate limits. Unsuccessful requests are not counted as usage.

Rate limits, quotas, and model availability are also configured per Cody feature - for example, you will have separate rate limits for Cody chat and completions.

In addition to the above, we may throttle concurrent requests to Cody Gateway per Sourcegraph Enterprise instance or Cody App user to prevent excessive burst consumption.

## Privacy and security

Sourcegraph Cody Gateway does not retain sensitive data (prompt test and source code included in requests, etc.) from any traffic received. Only rate limit consumption per Sourcegraph Enterprise license and high-level diagnostic data (error codes from upstream, numeric/enum request parameters, etc) are tracked.

For more details about Cody Gateway security practices, please contact your account manager. For more privacy details about Cody in general, refer to the [Cody usage and privacy notice](https://about.sourcegraph.com/terms/cody-notice).
