# CLI

<p className="subtitle">
	Interact with Sourcegraph and Cody from the command line interface.
</p>

`src` is a command line interface to Sourcegraph that allows you to <a href="/code-search">search code</a> from your terminal, <a href="/batch-changes">create and apply batch changes</a>, and <a href="/admin">manage and administrate repositories, users, and more</a>.

[Cody CLI](/cody/clients/install-cli) is the same technology that powers the Cody IDE plugins but available from the command-line. Use Cody CLI for ad-hoc exploration in your terminal or as part of scripts to automate your workflows.
