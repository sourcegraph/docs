## Usage

```

'src lsp' runs a Language Server Protocol server that proxies LSP
requests to Sourcegraph's code intelligence backend.

The server communicates over stdio (stdin/stdout) and is designed
to be used with editors like Neovim.

Prerequisites:
  - The working directory must be inside a Git repository
  - The repository must be indexed on your Sourcegraph instance
  - SRC_ENDPOINT and SRC_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variables must be set

Supported LSP methods:
  - textDocument/definition
  - textDocument/references
  - textDocument/hover
  - textDocument/documentHighlight

Example Neovim configuration (0.11+):

  vim.lsp.config['src-lsp'] = {
    cmd = { 'src', 'lsp' },
    root_markers = { '.git' },
    filetypes = { 'go', 'typescript', 'python' },
  }
  vim.lsp.enable('src-lsp')
