# Deep Search API

<p className="subtitle">Programmatic access to Sourcegraph's agentic code search capabilities.</p>

<Callout type="note">
	The Deep Search API is available in Sourcegraph version 6.7+. This API
	allows you to programmatically create and manage Deep Search
	conversations.
</Callout>

The Deep Search API provides programmatic access to Sourcegraph's agentic code search capabilities. Use this API to integrate Deep Search into your development workflows, build custom tools, or automate code analysis tasks.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using a Sourcegraph access token. You can generate an access token from your user settings.

```bash
# Set your access token
export SRC_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-token-here"
```

## Base URL

All Deep Search API endpoints are prefixed with `/.api/deepsearch/v1` and require the `X-Requested-With` header to identify the client:

```bash
curl 'https://your-sourcegraph-instance.com/.api/deepsearch/v1' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: token $SRC_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H 'X-Requested-With: my-client 1.0.0'
```

<Callout type="note">
	The `X-Requested-With` header is required and should include your client
	name and version number.
</Callout>

## Creating conversations

All Deep Search conversations are processed asynchronously. When you create a conversation, the API will return immediately with a conversation object containing the question in `processing` status.

Create a new Deep Search conversation by asking a question:

```bash
curl 'https://your-sourcegraph-instance.com/.api/deepsearch/v1' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: token $SRC_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H 'X-Requested-With: my-client 1.0.0' \
  -d '{"question":"Does github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph have a README?"}'
```

The API returns a conversation object with the question initially in `processing` status:

```json
{
  "id": 140,
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 163,
      "conversation_id": 140,
      "question": "Does github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph have a README?",
      "created_at": "2025-09-24T08:14:06Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-09-24T08:14:06Z",
      "status": "processing",
      "turns": [
        {
          "reasoning": "Does github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph have a README?",
          "timestamp": 1758701646,
          "role": "user"
        }
      ],
      "stats": {
        "time_millis": 0,
        "tool_calls": 0,
        "total_input_tokens": 0,
        "cached_tokens": 0,
        "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0,
        "prompt_tokens": 0,
        "completion_tokens": 0,
        "total_tokens": 0,
        "credits": 0
      },
      "suggested_followups": null
    }
  ],
  "created_at": "2025-09-24T08:14:06Z",

  "share_url": "https://your-sourcegraph-instance.com/deepsearch/caebeb05-7755-4f89-834f-e3ee4a6acb25"
}
```

To get the completed answer, poll the conversation endpoint:

```bash
curl 'https://your-sourcegraph-instance.com/.api/deepsearch/v1/140' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: token $SRC_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H 'X-Requested-With: my-client 1.0.0'
```

Once processing is complete, the response will include the answer:

```json
